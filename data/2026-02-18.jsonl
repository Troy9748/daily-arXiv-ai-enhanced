The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs: ~4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and ~12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative. Regardless of the dominant mechanism, the multi-wavelength differences offer a valuable probe of the physical state of the intervening medium."}

Because these features are extremely faint, alternative tracers such as globular clusters (GCs) provide a powerful tool to study cluster assembly. We use deep VLT/FORS $V$- and $I$-band imaging to investigate the GC population in the nearby Hydra I galaxy cluster ($\\sim 45.7$ Mpc). GC candidates were selected from the $VI$ colour-magnitude diagram and divided into blue and red subpopulations. We find a clear spatial dichotomy: red GCs are concentrated around the massive central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, while blue GCs are more extended and offset from the centre, coinciding with a secondary peak of X-ray-emitting gas. In the central regions, GC spatial distributions further depend on stellar population properties: young metal-rich GCs are more extended and may be linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are more centrally concentrated, possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies. Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster. This is also reflected in the specific frequency of blue GCs, which is approximately $\\sim 5\\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts than in the inner regions dominated by red GCs. Finally, we present a novel method to constrain the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function of the cluster using GC specific frequencies and colour distributions, yielding a past faint-end slope of $α=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ compared to $α=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ today, consistent with high-redshift observations and cosmological simulations."}

Detectability with non-standard primordial power spectrum", "comment": "51 pages, 30 figures", "summary": "Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe can imprint potentially observable signatures on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB."}

ABCMB has sub-percent-level agreement with CLASS and can be run on a GPU with competitive, and sometimes even faster, run times. It is refactored compared to previous codes and takes advantage of object-oriented programming to improve extensibility, meaning new physics can be added to it without the need for modifying source files. ABCMB provides accurate and stable gradients to the user, making Fisher analyses straightforward, and enabling the use of efficient gradient-based sampling methods."}

To this end, we focus on the class of $f(R,T)$ models defined by $f(R,T)=R+F(T)$, which provide a simple yet theoretically consistent realization of nonminimal matter-gravity interactions and can be reformulated as general relativity minimally coupled to a modified matter Lagrangian. Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure. Our results underscore the necessity of properly accounting for spatial averaging when modeling cosmology in theories with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings."}
