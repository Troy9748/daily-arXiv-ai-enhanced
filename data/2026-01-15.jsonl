VI. The Formation of Low-mass Multiple Systems in High-mass Cluster-forming Regions", "comment": "This paper has been accepted by ApJ", "summary": "Most stars form in multiple systems, with profound implications in numerous astronomical phenomena intrinsically linked to multiplicity. However, our knowledge about the process on how multiple stellar systems form is incomplete and biased toward nearby molecular clouds forming only low-mass stars, which are unrepresentative of the stellar population in the Galaxy. Most stars form within dense cores in clusters alongside high-mass stars (>8 M$_{\\odot}$), as likely the Sun did. Here we report deep ALMA 1.33 mm dust continuum observations at ~160 au spatial resolution, revealing 72 low-mass multiple systems embedded in 23 high-mass cluster-forming regions, as part of the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We find that the companion separation distribution presents a distinct peak at ~1200 au, in contrast to the one at ~4000 au observed in nearby low-mass regions. The shorter fragmentation scale can be explained by considering the higher pressure exerted by the surrounding medium, which is higher than the one in low-mass regions, due to the larger turbulence and densities involved. Because the peak of the companion separation distribution occurs at much larger scales than the expected disk sizes, we argue that the observed fragmentation is produced by turbulent core fragmentation. Contrary as predicted, the multiplicity fraction remains constant as the stellar density increases. We propose that in the extremely dense environments where high-mass stars form, dynamical interactions play an important role in disrupting weakly bound systems."}

At the same time, these observations challenge the validity of such classical methods when applied to the extreme environments typical at high redshift. We present an in-depth analysis of the ISM in three representative case studies at $z=2 - 6$ (MARTA 4327, the Sunburst Arc and RXCJ2248-ID) conducted within a multi-cloud photoionisation modelling framework (HOMERUN). We show that even a small fraction of unresolved high-density clumps can contribute more than half of the observed flux of auroral lines, while only negligibly to standard optical density tracers. As a result, $T_{\\mathrm{e}}$-method metallicities can be underestimated by $\\sim 0.15 - 0.3$ dex, as for MARTA 4327. By modelling rest-frame UV and optical data, we demonstrate that discrepancies between abundances obtained from diagnostics tracing different zones do not necessarily imply chemical inhomogeneities. In RXCJ2248-ID, the disagreement between UV and optical N/O may naturally arise from ionisation and density structure alone. In contrast, we find evidence for genuine chemical stratification in the Sunburst Arc, where a component enriched in nitrogen coexists with a chemically normal one. Finally, we argue that very-high-ionisation lines may be explained within a pure star-formation scenario invoking matter-bounded regions. However, in the case of RXCJ2248-ID, we cannot rule out a minor contribution from an AGN based solely on the observed fluxes. These results indicate that classical diagnostics can be significantly biased in high-redshift galaxies and that self-consistent, physically motivated tools are therefore essential to properly interpret the complex ISM conditions and chemical enrichment in the early Universe."}

X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating, high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts observed from the nuclei of a dozen nearby low-mass galaxies. Their origin remains a puzzle in the physics of accretion variability. Observational data indicate that X-ray and/or optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) may precede QPE detections. Although both kinds of outburst are driven by supermassive black holes, they are more frequently detected in faded active galactic nuclei (AGNs), when the TDE is not happening in a dormant galaxy. In the case of the QPE discovery source, GSN 069, it remains debated whether its past activity arose from a previous AGN phase or from an enhanced TDE rate. Aims. We investigated the origin of the past nuclear activity in GSN 069. Methods. Past AGN activity imprints detectable polarization in optical light, due to the expected delay between direct and scattered light. On 6 September 2019, we targeted GSN 069 with VLT/FORS2 in both imaging polarimetry and spectropolarimetry modes so that its optical polarization could be investigated while the first detected QPE phase was still active. Results. We measured a rising polarization, from ~0% to ~1.5%, as moving away from the nucleus of GSN 069. This rise is probed to be intrinsic to the central engine, confirming the already detected extended emission line region (EELR) by integral field unit data. Conclusions. The increasing radial polarization demonstrates a switched-off nucleus. The polarization angle traces an axis aligned with elongated [OIII], [NII], and Hα gas distributions, revealing an EELR that may be consistent with relic polarization cones, therefore suggesting the presence of a torus-like structure in the past. Thus, optical polarization echoes geometrically favor a faded AGN as the origin of the EELR rather than a past elevated TDE rate, although the latter cannot be excluded."}

However, it remains unclear whether quenching is primarily driven by one factor or results from a combination of mechanisms in individual GV galaxies. In this study, we address this question by examining the spatial distributions of star formation and molecular gas in 28 GVs selected from the ALMaQUEST survey and additional literature samples. For each galaxy, we identify regions with suppressed specific star formation rate (sSFR) and measure $Δf_{gas}$ and $Δ$SFE-offsets from the resolved scaling relations of the star-forming main sequence galaxies. By comparing the fraction of regions with negative $Δf_{gas}$ and $Δ$SFE, we classify 35.7$\\pm$13.2\\% (57.1$\\pm$17.9\\%) of GV galaxies as $f_{gas}$-driven, 39.3$\\pm$14.0\\% (39.3$\\pm$14.0\\%) as SFE-driven, and 25.0$\\pm$10.6\\% (3.6$\\pm$3.6\\%) as mixed mode when adopting a fixed (variable) CO-to-$\\rm H_{2}$ conversion factor ($α_{CO}$). These results indicate that GVs undergo quenching through multiple pathways. As sSFR decreases from the main sequence to the green valley, we observe a transition toward predominantly SFE-driven quenching, possibly linked to internal processes such as morphological quenching or AGN activity. We further estimate the quenching timescale ($τ_{decay}$), defined as the time from the peak SFR to 1/e (approximately 37\\%) of its value, using integrated MaNGA spectra. SFE-driven quenching is typically associated with short $τ_{decay}$ , while $f_{gas}$-driven quenching shows a broader range. Overall, 75\\% of GVs exhibit $τ_{decay}$ shorter than 1 Gyr, suggesting that quenching in most GVs proceeds rapidly, challenging purely slow-quenching scenarios like starvation."}

Referee received Nov 19 2025, accepted Jan 13 2026", "summary": "Recent space-based observations discovered several unusual objects, exhibiting similar properties, at redshifts $z\\gtrsim 10$. Among them is the UHZ1 system at $z=10.1$, containing $\\sim 10^8M_\\odot$ in stars, with a similarly massive central black hole of $\\sim 10^{7-8}M_\\odot$. Here we propose a possible mechanism for forming such systems which hinges on the presence of primordial black holes (PBHs) covering a range of masses while contributing a significant fraction of the dark matter (DM). We evaluate the accurate expression for the small-scale power responsible for the collapse of the first halos in the presence of the PBH population. The extra power in the matter density field, produced by the granulation term, will cause an earlier collapse of DM halos, populated by PBHs of different masses. In these collapsed and virialized systems the PBHs will undergo 2-body relaxation, driving the more massive PBHs to the halo center under dynamical friction. We quantify this evolution for a distribution of PBH orbital parameters and halo properties. The analysis shows that PBHs can have appropriate mass functions capable of producing systems with parameters similar to what is observed for UHZ1. We suggest that the proposed mechanism could account for a subset of other systems newly discovered with the JWST at high redshifts, including the Little Red Dots."}

The combined gravitational effects of these components, along with relativistic corrections from the BH's spin, generate strongly nonlinear dynamics and frequent chaotic orbital behaviour. To model this environment, we employ a multipolar expansion potential in which the central compact object is represented by the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov pseudo-Newtonian potential, effectively capturing spin-dependent features of a Kerr-like BH. The surrounding halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution expanded up to third order in multipolar terms to account for realistic asymmetry. Previous studies have mainly explored the influence of multipolar moments and BH spin using Poincare sections, SALI, and related chaos indicators. In this work, we extend these analyses by incorporating stability analysis and basins of convergence to achieve a more complete understanding of the system's dynamics. Stability analysis around equilibrium points provides insight into local behavior, while basins of convergence highlight sensitivity to initial conditions and expose fractal basin boundaries. Our results show that the BH spin significantly reshapes phase space: depending on its magnitude and orientation, it can either amplify chaotic scattering caused by halo asymmetry or stabilize specific orbital families. These findings enhance our understanding of how relativistic spin effects and multipolar mass distributions jointly govern the dynamical architecture of galactic centers."}

We perform spectral energy distribution fitting, at both global and spatial scales, using the THEMIS dust model within the HerBIE code, applied to data from 3.4 $μ$m to 6 cm. We decompose emission into dust, free-free, and synchrotron components, and examine correlations with gas surface density and star formation activity.

The code can be adapted for the selection of high-z galaxies, and although it has been tuned to the Euclid Wide Survey, it can be easily adapted to other photometric surveys. The code input data are the object's photometric data and its galactic longitude and latitude, and the code output data are the probabilities of the modelled populations of high-z quasars, brown dwarfs and early-type galaxies at intermediate redshift. As part of the validation, Owl-z could re-identify all spectroscopically confirmed quasars at z \\geq 7, demonstrating the code's versatility in applying to different photometric catalogues. The performance of Owl-z, based on a metric combining completeness and purity called F-measure, is analysed in the case of Euclid using simulated data in a wide range of redshifts (7 \\leq z \\leq 12) and H-band Euclid magnitudes (18 \\leq H_E \\leq 24.5). The results show that Owl-z reaches full performance for bright sources (H_E \\lesssim 22), independently of the redshift. We show that the probability threshold used to select promising quasar candidates can be adjusted after processing to fine-tune the F-measure value of candidates depending on their magnitude and redshift estimates. We show that for objects brighter than about two magnitudes above the survey detection limit, Owl-z provides a classification that will facilitate the optimisation of photometric and spectroscopic confirmation campaigns. In conclusion, Owl-z is a powerful public tool to help select high-z quasars, brown dwarfs or early-type galaxies at intermediate redshifts in Euclid or other wide-field surveys."}

We investigate how lens mass-profile assumptions affect time delays. Specifically, we implement a Broken Power Law (BPL) mass model within the Lenstronomy framework (Birrer & Amara 2018), which introduces additional flexibility in the radial mass distribution and can phenomenologically capture deviations from a single power-law profile. This model is combined with a numerical approach to compute time delays at the image positions. We validate the BPL implementation using simulated lenses and compare the results with those obtained from the elliptical power-law (EPL) model. We then apply both model families to the quadruply imaged quasar WGD~2038-4008. Both models fit the imaging and kinematic data comparably well, yet the greater radial freedom in the BPL model shifts the inferred time-delay distance -- and thus $H_0$ -- by an amount comparable to the current discrepancy between early- and late-universe $H_0$ estimates. In a flat $Λ$CDM cosmology, the $H_0$ inferred using the BPL lens model is $75^{+23.1}_{-16.3} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}},$ while the EPL model gives $H_0 = 61^{+19.2}_{-13.2} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}}.$ This difference is largely due to uncertainties in the inner mass profile ($θ<0.2''$), a region where point spread function (PSF) reconstruction is a critical factor -- a finding consistent with results reported in Shajib et al. (2022). This highlights how time-delay cosmography remains sensitive to assumptions about the lens mass profile. With current precision, this difference does not favor one cosmological scenario over another, but rather underscores the importance of flexible mass modeling and PSF modeling."}

The combinations FRB+GW, FRB+SGL, and FRB+21 cm IM each deliver simultaneous constraints on $H_0$ and $Ω_{\\rm b}$ better than ($1\\%$, $1\\%$) in the $Λ$CDM model, ($1.5\\%$, $2\\%$) in the $w$CDM model, and ($2\\%$, $3.5\\%$) in the CPL model. Moreover, in a model-independent framework, both FRB+GW and FRB+SGL constrain $H_0$ and $Ω_{\\rm b}$ to better than ($1\\%$, $2\\%$) precision. These results demonstrate that the synergy between FRBs and other emerging probes holds great promise for resolving the Hubble tension and locating the missing baryons."}

Accepted to A&A", "summary": "We investigate the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) at ~100 pc scales in a sample of 27 nearby luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) spanning the entire merger sequence. In particular, we study the relations between star-formation (SF) and molecular gas surface density as a function of the interaction stage using two complementary approaches: beam-sized (unresolved, line-of-sight) regions and physically identified molecular gas clumps. To map the distribution of molecular gas we use ALMA CO(2-1) observations, while SF is traced using HST Pa-alpha or Pa-beta images. We derive spatially resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relations for each galaxy. When using beam-sized regions, we find that 67% of galaxies follow a single relation between Sigma_SFR and Sigma_H2. However, in the remaining galaxies, the relation splits into two branches, indicating the presence of a duality in this relation. In contrast, when using physical gas clumps, the duality disappears and all galaxies show a single trend. We also study other ISM/clump properties as a function of the merger stage. We find that isolated galaxies and systems in early stages of interaction exhibit lower amounts of gas and SF. As the merger progresses, however, the amount of gas in the central kpc of the galaxy undergoing the merger increases, along with the SFR, and the slope of the KS relation becomes steeper, indicating an increase in SF efficiency of the gas clumps. Clumps in late-stage mergers are predominantly located at small distances from the nucleus, confirming that most of the activity is concentrated in the central regions. Finally, the relation between the SF efficiency and the boundedness parameter evolves from being roughly flat in the early stages of the merger to becoming positive in the final phases, indicating that clump self-gravity only starts to regulate the SF process between the early- and mid-merger stages."}

In BDE-CDM, dark energy originates from the lightest meson field within a supersymmetric SU(3) dark gauge group with $N_f = 6$ flavors, governed by an inverse power-law potential $V(φ) = Λ_{c}^{4+2/3} φ^{-2/3}$. Unlike $Λ$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM, the dark energy sector contains no free parameters -- the condensation scale $Λ_c$ and transition epoch $a_c$ are determined by gauge coupling unification constraints. The equation of state evolves from relativistic behavior ($w = 1/3$) before condensation through a kinetic-dominated stiff phase ($w \\simeq 1$), approaching $w_0 = -0.9298 \\pm 0.0003$ at present, with $w > -1$ maintained throughout cosmic history, avoiding phantom-regime instabilities. We obtain $Λ_{c} = 43.93 \\pm 0.13$~eV and $a_c = (2.489 \\pm 0.007) \\times 10^{-6}$, consistent with theoretical predictions. The $w_0$-$w_a$ confidence contours are approximately 10,000 times smaller than those of $w_0w_a$CDM while achieving comparable fits, and remain stable across different supernova datasets. Statistical analysis yields $Δ\\mathrm{DIC} = -6.77$ and $Δ\\mathrm{AIC} = -8.97$ relative to $Λ$CDM for BAO+DESY5, constituting strong evidence favoring BDE-CDM model. The model predicts distinctive signatures including 25\\% enhancement in the matter power spectrum at $k \\approx 4.3\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. These results establish BDE-CDM as a theoretically motivated framework that successfully addresses the DESI-observed preference for dynamical dark energy while connecting particle physics with cosmological observations."}

This UV field is a major agent of ionization and dissociation in the inner regions of molecular clouds that are shielded from the effects of the interstellar radiation field. In particular, the dissociation of $\\rm H_2$, by far the most abundant molecule in interstellar clouds, leads to the production of atomic hydrogen which then takes part in the production of a multitude of molecules, in particular complex organics on the surfaces of interstellar dust grains. Precise knowledge of the rates of CR-induced dissociation processes is thus crucial for constructing reliable chemical models. For the present paper, we have derived a new value of $k_{\\rm diss, CR}(\\mbox{$\\rm H_2$})=0.831ζ$ for the rate of $\\rm H_2$ dissociation, where $ζ$ is the CR ionization rate of $\\rm H_2$. This prediction contrasts a previous value from the Leiden database which overestimated the rate due to an inconsistent treatment of the $\\rm H_2$ abundances and photodissociation cross sections. By running a series of chemical models, we show that the overestimated dissociation rate has a large effect on the results of chemical simulations, with the abundance of methanol being overestimated by over one order of magnitude. Hence, we strongly recommend the adoption of our new estimate $k_{\\rm diss, CR}(\\mbox{$\\rm H_2$})=0.831ζ$ in all chemical models that include this process. Our newly derived value corresponds to $\\rm H_2$ being purely in the para form ($J^{\\prime\\prime} = 0$). However, in the interiors of molecular clouds the $\\rm H_2$ ortho-to-para ratio is low and using the rate for para-$\\rm H_2$ is an adequate approximation."}

As in stripped nuclear star clusters, the SMBHs in UCDs may be fed by stellar winds from old stellar populations, in the absence of substantial gas reservoirs and galactic inflows. In this work, we investigate such a wind-fed accretion scenario for M60-UCD1, which harbors a confirmed $2\\times10^7~M_\\odot$ SMBH and exhibits X-ray emission suggestive of SMBH accretion signature. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we simulate the SMBH accreting stellar winds from approximately 1500 asymptotic giant branch stars, and explore the role of ram pressure from the ambient interstellar or intracluster medium. After 5 Myr, the majority of the stellar winds form a cold gas disk ($\\sim1000~M_\\odot$) within $\\sim10~\\rm pc$ as well as the SMBH's gravitational sphere of influence. Within the inner $10^4~r_{\\rm g}$, this disk transitions into a hot ($\\sim10^7-10^9~\\rm K$), geometrically thick corona that dominates the X-ray emission. The SMBH achieves an accretion rate of $\\sim10^{-5}~M_\\odot~\\rm yr^{-1}$, yielding an X-ray luminosity of $\\sim7\\times10^{37}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, well consistent with observations. Including ram pressure stripping reduces both the accretion rate and luminosity by about a factor of two. Our results suggest that the X-ray counterpart of M60-UCD1 originates from a weakly accreting SMBH fed by stellar winds, with broader insights into the feeding mechanisms of central massive black holes and the origins of X-ray sources in other UCDs."}
