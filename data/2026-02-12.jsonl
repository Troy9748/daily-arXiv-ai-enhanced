Webb"], "title": "Beyond $Λ$CDM: fundamental constants as cosmological observables", "comment": "White Paper submitted to ESO's Expanding Horizons initiative", "summary": "Recent cosmological tensions pose difficulties for $Λ$CDM. Forthcoming facilities will be able to check whether these tensions result from systematic effects or indeed with the $Λ$CDM model itself. However, these new data will primarily probe gravitational interactions and provide only limited information about non-gravitational interactions. Distinguishing between competing models that make similar predictions yet rely on fundamentally different principles, therefore requires suitably diverse physical tests. Observational constraints on spacetime variations of fundamental constants fill this need. The fine-structure constant, $α= e^2/\\hbar c$, can be measured using absorption systems towards bright quasars using the Many Multiplet method, and using atomic doublets from line emitting gas in galaxies. A spectroscopic facility such as the WST could produce more than 100,000 new measurements of $α$ from quasars together with a million measurements from galaxies. When combined with other probes, such a large and homogeneous dataset of $α$ measurements would provide unprecedented constraints on physics beyond $Λ$CDM."}

However, the direct measurement of the stellar IMF is confined to the local universe, limited by the resolving power of telescopes. Recently, a new method for accessing the stellar IMF beyond the local universe has been developed. The observed detection rate of transient lensed stars -- individual, massive, thus luminous stars in strongly lensed galaxies that are temporarily detectable upon stellar microlensing -- can serve as a probe to break the IMF-star formation history degeneracy in studies utilizing spectral energy distribution fitting, hence providing a window to look at the IMF at a subsample of gravitationally lensed galaxies. In this proceeding, I summarize the contributed talk given at IAUS402 entitled the same as this contribution and highlight some key results, which currently show no evidence for a top-heavy IMF in $z \\approx 1$ galaxies."}

Dynamical Masses and Metallicities for a Uniform Sample of Milky Way Satellites", "comment": "19 pages, 9 figures, 1 table. Submitted to ApJ. For access to all data tables see https://geha-group.github.io/deimos", "summary": "Population-level studies of Milky Way satellites used to constrain dark matter or the threshold of galaxy formation often rely on velocity dispersions and metallicities derived from heterogeneous spectroscopic analyses. Systematic differences between data reduction pipelines and membership criteria can masquerade as astrophysical signals, or obscure real trends. Here, we present the largest self-consistent sample of spectroscopically-derived quantities for Milky Way satellite galaxies and globular clusters based on a homogeneous re-analysis of individual stars observed with the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph. We determine enclosed dynamical masses, mean [Fe/H] metallicities, and metallicity dispersions for 67 systems with 10 or more member stars. At a given stellar mass, systems classified as satellite galaxies are well separated from globular clusters in their dynamical mass and mass-to-light ratios. The average enclosed mass densities of satellite galaxies agree with semi-analytic CDM model predictions. For satellite galaxies, we observe a break in the stellar mass-metallicity relation near log M*/Msun = 4 (M_V ~ -4.5). Above this stellar mass, satellite galaxies show the well-known tight trend (0.16 dex scatter in [Fe/H]) of decreasing metallicity with stellar mass; below log M*/Msun = 4, the mass-metallicity relation flattens and/or increases in scatter. Satellite galaxies have internal metallicity scatter between 0.3-0.4 dex across our stellar mass range. These uniform measurements will enable tighter constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relation, improved J-factor estimates for dark matter searches, and lay a foundation for interpreting the flood of new Milky Way satellites expected in the LSST/Roman/Euclid era."}

Mazengo"], "title": "The stellar-to-halo mass relation of central galaxies across three orders of halo mass", "comment": "Submitted to A&A; 12 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "The stellar content of galaxies is tightly connected to the mass and growth of their host dark matter halos. Observational constraints on this relation remain limited, particularly for low-mass groups, leaving uncertainties in how galaxies assemble their stars across halo mass scales. Accurately measuring the brightest central galaxy (BCG) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) over a wide mass range is therefore crucial for understanding galaxy formation and the role of feedback processes. Here we present the SHMR spanning $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12}$-$10^{15}\\,M_\\odot$, using halo masses derived from eROSITA eRASS1 X-ray data and BCG stellar masses based on SDSS photometry. By stacking X-ray spectra of optically selected groups, we recover robust average halo gas temperatures for each bin, which are then converted to halo masses via the $M$-$T_X$ relation. We find that the SHMR peaks near $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12}\\,M_\\odot$, with a declining stellar fraction at higher masses. This trend reflects a combination of processes that reduce the efficiency of stellar mass growth in massive halos, such as AGN feedback, reduced cooling efficiency, and the increasing dominance of ex-situ assembly, while halos continue to grow through mergers and accretion. Our measurements are consistent over the full mass range with previous observational studies, including weak lensing, X-ray analyses of individual clusters, and kinematical and dynamical methods. Comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations show good agreement at low masses but reveal significant discrepancies in the normalization at cluster scales, highlighting the sensitivity of BCG stellar growth to feedback prescriptions and halo assembly history. These results provide the first X-ray-based observational SHMR covering three orders of magnitude in halo mass, establish a robust benchmark for testing galaxy formation models."}
