Submitted to A&A. Comments are welcome", "summary": "The nature of dark matter (DM) is still debated. While cold DM (CDM) is the standard paradigm, warm DM (WDM) may ease some small-scale tensions in the $Λ$CDM framework. Line-intensity mapping (LIM) offers a novel probe of DM properties. To explore the potential of LIM surveys in constraining the WDM particle mass ($m_\\mathrm{WDM}$) by means of the [C II] power spectrum (PS), we provide forecasts for the Deep Spectroscopic Survey (DSS) at $z\\simeq3.6$ and extend the analysis to larger sky coverage, higher sensitivity, and/or increased spectral resolution. We develop a formulation for the [C II] PS based on the halo-model approach, incorporating the uncertainty in the luminosity function (LF) through two alternative parameterisations. We perform a Bayesian analysis on mock data to derive constraints on $m_\\mathrm{WDM}$. In a CDM universe, the DSS yields lower limits on $m_\\mathrm{WDM}$ at $95\\%$ credibility level (CL) of $1.10$ keV and $0.58$ keV when considering the optimistic and pessimistic LF ($α= -1.1$), respectively. Ambitious surveys can improve these figures to $5.82$ keV and $1.90$ keV, and assuming a steeper faint-end slope ($α= -1.9$) further boosts these limits. A fivefold increase in spectral resolution enhances sensitivity to the damping scale associated to redshift-space distortions, tightening the constraints on $m_\\mathrm{WDM}$ by a factor of up to $\\sim1.8$. Finally, Bayesian inference on mock data with $m_\\mathrm{WDM}=3$ keV results in a well-constrained and unbiased posterior only in futuristic survey setups. Upcoming LIM surveys can provide meaningful limits on $m_\\mathrm{WDM}$, although the negligible contribution from small haloes reduces the constraining power of the [C II] PS. Future progress will benefit from combining multiple redshifts and emission lines, opening the way to competitive constraints on the nature of DM."}

Current and upcoming CMB experiments such as SPT-3G and the Simons Observatory (SO) provide high-resolution, low-noise temperature and polarization maps that are ideal for lensing reconstruction. The global minimum variance (GMV) quadratic estimator for CMB lensing reduces reconstruction noise over the standard quadratic estimator (SQE). In this work, we extend the GMV framework to incorporate the tSZ-deproj and cross-ILC foreground mitigation techniques, which enhance robustness against contamination from astrophysical sources.

This fraction is lower than predicted by simulations, which suggest that fast outflowing gas should be a common feature of all star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. Aims: In order to better understand the discrepancies between simulations and observations, we identify and characterize outflows in high-redshift galaxies using the TNG50 cosmological and SERRA zoom-in simulations. Our study examines how outflow detectability depends on the line of sight, explores the properties of the fast gas, and investigates its relationship with key galactic properties. Methods: We analyse approximately 60000 galaxies from TNG50 and 3000 galaxies from SERRA over the redshift ranges z=3-5 and z=4-5, respectively, spanning stellar masses of Mstar=10^7.5-10^11Msun. Outflows in the immediate vicinity of each galaxy are identified using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm that uses the gas velocity, star-formation-rate, and location as input parameters. We subsequently compare the simulated outflows to those observed in the JWST/JADES NIRSpec survey. Results: Outflow masses in both TNG50 and SERRA broadly reproduce the JWST/JADES measurements within roughly 0.5dex, though simulations tend to predict slightly higher values, suggesting that optical emission lines capture only a fraction of the multiphase outflow. However, simulated outflow velocities are typically an order of magnitude lower than those inferred from observations. TNG50 indicates a clear orientation dependence as outflows in face-on galaxies are approximately 15% more likely to be detected than in edge-on systems, with this difference increasing to nearly 40% for more massive, disc-shaped galaxies."}

Accepted as a Letter in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "A subset of very young, super-early galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$, often termed Blue Monsters, shows extremely blue UV continua and faint far-IR emission, which could imply much less dust than expected from standard enrichment scenarios. We seek to understand the possible reason behind the apparent absence of dust in the Blue Monsters. We show how clustered supernovae drive mechanical blowout in stratified, self-gravitating clouds by combining full 3-D hydrodynamical dust-survival yields with 3-D thin-shell scalings, and we predict the retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio at the cluster scale and the corresponding galaxy-integrated value. We take the net dust yield per unit stellar mass from existing 3-D hydrodynamical studies of young stellar clusters with sequential supernovae, and we set the blowout radius as a function of gas concentration using established 3-D thin-shell scalings. Assuming gas-dust coupling across the blowout boundary, the retained dust-to-stellar ratio accounts for the fraction of supernovae that remain confined versus those that vent mechanically. Across typical cluster masses, sizes, and cloud-scale star formation efficiencies, mechanical venting removes a large share of gas and dust. The retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio is lowered by about half to two orders of magnitude relative to the supernova net dust yield. The outcome depends mainly on gas concentration and only weakly on metallicity, so it remains effective at low $Z$. After weighting by a Schechter cluster mass function and a Weibull core-radius distribution, the galaxy-integrated value falls in the same range inferred for spectroscopically confirmed Blue Monsters. Thus, mechanical venting at the cluster scale can account for the very low dust fractions inferred for Blue Monsters without requiring extreme in situ destruction and without fine-tuning."}

Using three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson simulations of multiple soliton mergers, we explore both repulsive and attractive regimes across a wide range of scattering lengths. Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo. These results demonstrate that self-interactions provide a natural mechanism to regulate core properties, with important implications for the formation of supermassive black holes and for potential astrophysical signatures in galactic cores."}

In particular, GWs induced by primordial isocurvature perturbations encode information of novel dynamics beyond the standard $Λ$CDM model. Existing studies of isocurvature induced GWs focus on a particular type: cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature. In this work, we present a more comprehensive study of four kinds of isocurvature involving CDM, baryons, neutrinos and free-streaming dark radiation (DR). We first reformulate initial conditions of isocurvature with coupled neutrinos because modes relevant for observations at Pulsar Timing Arrays enter the horizon before neutrino decoupling. With these new initial conditions, neutrino isocurvature is phenomenologically similar to CDM isocurvature up to an overall coefficient, which leads to an interesting conversion of isocurvature between radiation and matter sectors. We then find that the spectrum of isocurvature induced GWs from free-streaming DR is qualitatively different than that from CDM due to the presence of anisotropic stress. Unlike GWs induced by CDM isocurvature that are suppressed at high frequencies due to matter density being suppressed at early times, DR isocurvature induced GWs is proportional to the constant ratio between DR density and total radiation. Finally, we utilize two general parametrizations of the isocurvature power spectrum: a delta function and a broken power law, and derive novel constraints with recent NANOGrav data. Our results set stringent constraints on isocurvature around $10^{6}\\,\\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, which are complementary to cosmological observations at large scales."}

In the post-Friedmann expansion framework, a weak-field relativistic approximation purpose-built for cosmology, a frame-dragging gravito-magnetic vector potential arises at leading order, sourced by momentum currents, contributing to the metric even if the dynamics of matter fields at this order is Newtonian, and can thus be extracted from $N$-body simulations. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator code on the IllustrisTNG simulations, here we extend previous work in order to compute the power spectrum of this vector potential down to galactic scales. The magnitude of the vector potential is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by perturbation theory, and is a $1\\% \\sim 0.1\\%$ effect compared to the non-linear Newtonian scalar gravitational potential. In the red-shift range considered here, the gravito-magnetic effect remains subdominant, without showing any enhancement during a particular phase in the evolution of structures, aside from the continuous growth of non-linearity at low redshift. Although this seems to suggest that, within the $Λ$CDM model, no significant gravito-magnetic effects contribute to the non-linear evolution of cosmic structures, i.e. to the dynamics of massive particles, possible observational consequences, e.g. in lensing, deserve further exploration."}

Leveraging detections of faint auroral emission lines in 76 galaxies at z>1 from both the MARTA survey and a large compilation of high-redshift literature objects, we derive direct electron temperature-based abundances for nitrogen and oxygen using rest-frame optical lines. We establish the first high-redshift calibrations of strong-line N/O diagnostics based on direct abundance measurements, finding no significant evolution for either N2O2 = [NII]6585/[OII]3727,3729 and N2S2 = [NII]6585/[SII]6717,6731 diagnostics compared to local realisations. We then investigate the N/O-O/H relation across cosmic time using both direct abundances and strong-line based measurements (additional 430 galaxies). We find evidence for mild but systematic nitrogen enhancement at high redshift: galaxies at z>1 exhibit N/O ratios elevated by ~0.18 dex (median offset) at fixed O/H compared to the local relation, with a more pronounced enhancement at low metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.1) where the offset reaches up to ~0.3-0.4 dex. Our results provide the most extensive confirmation of elevated N/O ratios at high-redshift to date based on rest-optical diagnostics. The chemical signatures of N/O-enhanced galaxies in our sample resembles that of first-generation globular cluster stars, suggesting that the moderate nitrogen enhancement may reflect the late stages of a cluster-driven enrichment mode that dominated at earlier cosmic epochs. However, the relevance and relative contribution of different mechanisms (e.g. burstiness of the star-formation history, contribution from older stellar populations, differential metal-loaded outflows, inflows of pristine gas) remains to be fully disentangled."}

No bimodality appears in the stellar metallicity-mass relation, which changes from steep to flat across 10^10.8Msun. Similar trends emerge for age and metallicity with velocity dispersion, but with sharper transition from young to old around log(sigma)=2.3. Differences with respect to trens with stellar mass suggest that age primarily depends on velocity dispersion below and above the transition regime, while both stellar mass and velocity dispersion contribute to stellar metallicity.

To be cited alongside the accompanying Paper III, White et al. (2025c)", "summary": "We provide an updated 'multiwavelength' version of the G4Jy catalogue (available at https://github.com/svw26/G4Jy, https://zenodo.org/communities/g4jy/records, and through VizieR), which has 127 new host-galaxy identifications, as described in Paper III of this paper series. We also supplement the redshift information (0.0 < z < 3.6) gathered in Paper III with $griz$ photometry available through DR10 of the DESI Legacy Surveys. Together, this legacy dataset allows us to investigate the multiwavelength properties of these southern radio-bright galaxies, which includes an initial analysis of radio spectral-curvature for this complete sample (S_151MHz > 4 Jy). For example, we present (for the first time in the literature) the radio-power--size diagram as a function of radio spectral-curvature, [P--D](SCI), noting that the spectral-curvature index (SCI) can act as a proxy for the spectral age of the radio source. This radio-power--size--age diagram shows an interesting predominance of candidate remnant radio-galaxies (SCI > 0.15) with D < 200 kpc (although these may instead be young radio-sources), and a vast range of linear sizes for candidate restarted radio-galaxies (SCI < -0.15). We also show that (i) G4Jy sources populate the entirety of WISE colour-colour space, (ii) optically point-like sources (i.e. candidate quasars) are brighter than the well-studied K--z relation (as expected), and (iii) there is no relation between the SCI of the radio source and its host-galaxy properties."}

Submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics", "summary": "An accurate characterisation of the physical properties of galaxies at cosmic dawn is key to understanding the origin of the high abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z$\\gtrsim$10. We exploit deep NIRSpec PRISM observations of GHZ2 to constrain the sources of ionising radiation and the properties of the ISM in this bright, compact, and highly ionising galaxy at z=12.3. We measure with high significance the prominent N IV, C IV, He II, O III, C III, O II, and Ne III emission features previously detected in shallower observations, and confirm the detection of the N III] $λ1750$ multiplet, yielding tight constraints on the N/O ratio, which is found to be $\\simeq$2 times the solar value. We also detect the Mg II $λ2800$, [Fe IV] $λ2833$ and Si II $λ1812$ doublets, the H8+HeI $λλ3889$ blend, and the Si IV+O IV] $λλ1400$ absorption complex. The O III $λ3133$ fluorescence line is only detected in the first observing epoch, implying variability on a rest-frame time span of 19 days, strongly suggesting the presence of an active nucleus. Combining the NIRSpec dataset with available optical and far-infrared constraints from MIRI and ALMA, we show that the emission spectrum of GHZ2 cannot be reproduced by single-density spectro-photometric models. Multi-zone photoionisation modelling performed with the HOMERUN code demonstrates that star formation must be occurring in a strongly stratified ISM, where both low-/intermediate-density gas and high-density regions (log($n_e$/cm$^{-3}) \\gtrsim 4$) coexist. The GHZ2 emission landscape is consistent with either a composite star-formation plus AGN scenario, or with star formation occurring in a combination of radiation- and matter-bounded regions. Purely radiation-bounded stellar models fail to reproduce the observed He II emission, making an additional hard ionising component unavoidable."}

While most astrochemists are oriented to observe molecules in the gas phase and reproduce their abundances by modeling the physical conditions of the medium, the microscopic dust particles wandering in the interstellar medium deserve the attention of a smaller community. Radiation and thermally-driven processes taking place in the bare dust, and particularly in dust particles covered by ice mantles, are mimicked in the laboratory. In addition to water, interstellar ice contains other simple species. In this Review we present our current knowledge on ice photochemistry and thermal processing that ultimately leads to formation of complex organic molecules (COMs). Numerous COMs are of astrobiological interest and match those present in comets and asteroids. Upon impact of these minor bodies, water and COMs were delivered to the earth and might have intervened in the first prebiotic reactions."}
