We measure morphological properties from the mock imaging through Sersic profile fitting, and gas rotational velocities ($v$) and velocity dispersions ($σ$) by fitting the mock spectra as thin, rotating discs.

At $z=3$, we find that $v$ and $σ$ for aligned and resolved sources generally agree well with intrinsic measurements, within a factor of $\\sim$2 and $\\sim$1.5, respectively. The recovery of kinematics is robust for smooth, disc-like systems, but $v$ and $σ$ can be over- or underestimated by more than a factor of 2, respectively, for intrinsically elongated systems. The scatter in the recovery accuracy is larger at higher redshift, as TNG50 galaxies at $z>3$ deviate more strongly from the thin rotating disc assumption. Despite uncertain measurements for individual galaxies, we find that key population trends, such as the weak redshift evolution of $σ$ and $v/σ$ as well as the dependence of $σ$ on the global star formation rate, are broadly recovered by our kinematic modelling.

We investigate the impact of diffuse ionised gas (DIG) on the determination of emission line ratios and gas-phase metallicities in two local analogues of high-redshift star-forming galaxies: UM 462 and IIZw 40. Understanding how DIG affects these quantities is essential for interpreting unresolved observations of distant galaxies, where integrated spectra are often used to trace their chemical evolution. Methods. Using archival Very Large Telescope, Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data, we spatially resolved the warm ionised medium of both galaxies. We derived oxygen abundances through the direct method and several HII-based strong-line calibrators, and we used the H$α$ surface brightness ($Σ$(H$α$)) to distinguish regions dominated by HII or DIG emission. Results. Oxygen abundances derived from the N2 and O3N2 indices show an inverse correlation with $Σ$(H$α$), ionisation parameter, and EW(H$α$), with DIG-dominated regions exhibiting higher 12+log(O/H) than the galaxy mean by $\\sim$0.2 dex in UM 462 and $\\sim$0.1 dex in IIZw 40. The metallicity differences between HII-dominated and DIG-dominated $Σ$(H$α$) bins reach $\\sim$0.4 dex and $\\sim$0.3 dex in UM 462 and IIZw 40, respectively. The observed trends with $Σ$(H$α$), metallicity, EW(H$α$), and ionisation parameter indicate smoothly varying ionisation conditions rather than true abundance variations. These effects reflect different ionisation sources and levels, and can produce spurious metallicity gradients in galaxies with extended DIG structures, potentially mimicking signatures of metal-poor gas infall. In our sample, DIG ionisation is most likely dominated by photon leakage from H II regions, with additional contributions from feedback-driven shocks."}

Using a tree-level perturbative description for the 21-cm brightness-temperature field in redshift space, and adopting the Hu--Sawicki $f(R)$ model as a representative modified-gravity scenario, we forecast the detectability of configuration-dependent signatures with an \\texttt{SKA-MID}--like survey. We derive the bispectrum-multipole covariance including sample variance and thermal noise and evaluate the expected signal-to-noise of deviations relative to $Λ$CDM. We find that the observable information is dominated by the lowest multipoles, while higher-order modes are strongly suppressed. This concentration in the lowest multipoles is well matched to \\texttt{SKA-MID} sensitivity and to the quasi-linear modes that are expected to remain accessible in practice. The strongest modified-gravity sensitivity arises from squeezed and stretched triangle configurations on quasi-linear scales, where scale-dependent growth enhances the bispectrum relative to the total variance.

The variation of the mass distribution of the LSS of the universe implies that observers residing in different locations may suffer bias in their measurements when they look at the images of distant galaxies. Here, we assess the influence of the local environment on weak gravitational lensing (WL) shear statistics in the context of relativistic $N$-body code, \\texttt{gevolution}. We derive numerical constraints on the cosmological parameters from the WL shear angular power spectrum and comment on the local environment's influence on WL shear. We find tighter constraints on the parameter $Ω_\\mathrm{m}$ above redshift $z$ = 0.2, which implies over this redshift the local environment's impact is minor. We also investigate the bispectrum and conclude that on average the impact of the local environment on $f_{\\rm NL}$ (a measure of non-Gaussianities) is minimal and consistent with zero effect. However, we find that within the assembly of all possible observers/locations, there will also be a few that could infer the parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$ of the order 10.

An efficient sampler propagates quickly in all regions of the parameter space, so that the chain has a low autocorrelation length and the sampler has a high acceptance rate, with the goal of optimising the number of near-independent samples for given computational cost. Standard Gaussian momentum distributions allow arbitrarily large velocities, which can lead to inefficient exploration in posteriors with ridges or funnel-like geometries. We investigate alternative momentum distributions based on relativistic and Student's t kinetic energies, which naturally limit particle velocities and may improve robustness. Using Almanac, a sampler for cosmological posterior distributions of sky maps and power spectra on the sphere, we test these alternatives in both low- and high-dimensional settings. We find that the choice of parameterization and momentum distribution can improve convergence and effective sample rate, though the achievable gains are generally modest and strongly problem-dependent, reaching up to an order of magnitude in favorable cases. Among the momentum distributions that we tested, those with moderately heavy tails achieved the best balance between efficiency and stability. These results highlight the importance of sampler design and encourage future work on adaptive and self-tuning strategies for kinetic energy parameter optimization in high-dimensional settings."}

Using the updated getsf algorithm on the Cygnus X column-density map, we extracted 2633 filaments and 6551 cores. We built CMFs for cores on and off filaments, compared filament orientations with the Planck B field, measured radial column-density profiles near HII-region boundaries, and computed distances between young stellar objects and filament spines. Filaments have a typical width of 0.5 pc in Cygnus X at a resolution of 0.12 pc and host > 93% of high-mass cores (>= 20 Msun). The on-filament CMF shows a high-mass (> 10 Msun) slope of -2.30, while the off-filament CMF is steeper (-2.83). The onCMF peak mass is well below the Bonnor-Ebert mass, whereas the outCMF peak is comparable to it. At 5' resolution, filaments are mostly perpendicular to the B field except at the lowest column densities; the transition occurs near Av = 10 mag. Prominent filaments and high-mass cores preferred to be located around HII-region boundaries or at intersections of multiple HII regions; filament profiles are steeper on the side facing the HII region. Massive-core formation depends strongly on filaments, which may provide reservoirs that feed cores via accretion.

Formed in the immediate vicinity of Sgr~A$^\\ast$, these stars are accelerated to velocities high enough to escape the GC and be observable in the Galactic halo. Using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and astrometry from Gaia, we conducted a six-dimensional search for HVSs and identified a compelling candidate, hereafter DESI-312, whose bound trajectory can be confidently traced back to the GC. The star resides in the inner halo and exhibits supersolar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.27\\pm 0.09$), distinct from other known stellar populations with radial orbits. Its inferred GC ejection velocity of $698^{+35}_{-27}$ is consistent with a Hills mechanism ejection, supporting an origin in the innermost regions of the Milky Way. We considered alternative origins for the star, including disk ejections from young clusters and globular clusters, but these scenarios fail to explain both its orbit and metallicity. Unlike previously identified A- and B-type HVSs, DESI-312 is a $\\sim 1\\,M_{\\odot}$ star on the main sequence or early subgiant branch, thus enabling a detailed chemical analysis of its atmosphere and offering a rare window - unobscured by dust and crowding - into the composition of the central regions of the Galaxy."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Clusters of galaxies have been used to measure a subtle effect predicted by Einstein: gravitational redshift. This signal encodes pristine information about our Universe, since it is sensitive to the depth of the clusters' gravitational potential wells. In this work, we show how gravitational redshift can be used to test a fundamental physical principle: the weak equivalence principle. This principle stipulates that all matter falls in the same way in a gravitational potential, regardless of its nature. By comparing the amplitude of the gravitational redshift signal with the velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters, we build a novel test of this principle targeted to the unknown dark matter. Our test is sensitive to any additional interaction that would alter the way dark matter falls in gravitational potentials, hence leading to a violation of the equivalence principle. We show that currently available data can constrain the presence of a fifth force in clusters at the level of 7-14%, while the newest surveys will reach a precision of a few percents. This demonstrates the crucial role played by galaxy clusters in testing fundamental properties of dark matter."}
