Nath"], "title": "Dust destruction in bubbles driven by multiple supernovae explosions", "comment": "10 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "Dust lifetime derived from an isolated supernova (SN) evolution in the interstellar medium is known to be an order of magnitude shorter than the time needed to replenish dust mass by its production in various Galactic sources. We show, using 3-D numerical hydrodynamical simulations, that destruction of dust in the case of multiple SNe in a star cluster is markedly different from that in an isolated SN. We find that the mass of dust destroyed in the bubble does not grow for a considerable time, while SNe continue to explode. This regime is attained at saturation timescale, which is proportional to SNe rate in cluster. We show that the mass of dust destroyed in bubble per SN decreases for higher SN rate. Thus, the destruction efficiency -- defined as the ratio of the the total mass of dust destroyed by clustered SNe to that destroyed by the same number of isolated SNe -- in bubbles evolved in a homogeneous medium drops for massive clusters, e.g. around clusters with $M_\\ast > 4\\times 10^4 M_\\odot$ it is less $0.4$\\%. For lower mass clusters, the efficiency is proportional to the average time delay between SNe. We found that each cluster with $M_\\ast < 4\\times 10^4 M_\\odot$ destroys the same mass of dust as a single isolated SN. In a clumpy medium in bubbles formed around clusters with $M_\\ast \\sim 4\\times 10^4 M_\\odot$ and up to 4 times around $M_\\ast \\sim 8\\times 10^5 M_\\odot$. We argue that the interstellar dust swept up by multiple SNe almost completely survives in the shells of bubbles around such massive clusters. Therefore, the destruction of the interstellar dust is controlled by SNe in low-mass clusters. We point out that the interstellar dust lifetime for a given SN rate is at least a factor $\\sim 10$ longer as compared to the estimates derived from an isolated SN. (abridged)"}

Vasiliev"], "title": "Destruction of the interstellar dust by a supernova", "comment": "8 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Destruction of the interstellar dust proceeds primary behind supernova shocks. The previous estimates of the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant do not take into account the physical properties of the ambient medium. Here we consider how some parameters, i.e. gas density and metallicity, can influence the destruction of the interstellar dust. We show that there are two regimes of the interstellar dust grains destruction in SN remnants: rapid and almost complete in compact low-mass SN remnants expanding in dense medium, and gradual and weak destruction in massive remnants evolving in the low-dense environment. When time for thermal sputtering is close to the dynamical one, i.e. to the SN remnant age, the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed in the SN remnant reaches its maximum value. We find that change of the ambient gas density results in the reduction of the dust mass logarithmically. We argue that dust cooling suppresses the interstellar dust destruction up to a factor of 1.6 by mass. This factor decreases for higher density of the ambient medium. We found that the dust mass depends linearly on gas metallicity as ${\\rm log}~M_d \\sim {\\rm [Z/H]}$ or, in other words, on the dust-to-gas ratio as $M_d \\sim ζ_d$. In turn, the destruction efficiency is higher in low-metallicity environments due to relatively longer adiabatic phase. We point out that the mass of the interstellar dust destroyed per one SN in a high density environment of the high star formation regions like in local ultraluminous infrared and high-redshift massive galaxies is about several times smaller than that in the Milky Way diffuse medium."}

Based on arXiv:2202.11081, arXiv:2304.04463, arXiv:2310.19664 and arXiv:2412.03547", "summary": "In this thesis, we investigate the possibility that dark matter consists of ultra light spin-zero particles with mass $m \\sim 10^{-22}\\ \\text{eV}$. We focus on the role of self-interactions, assuming all other non-gravitational couplings to Standard Model particles are negligible. Such ultra light dark matter (ULDM) is expected to form stable self-gravitating scalar field configurations (solitons), whose properties depend on the particle mass and self-coupling $λ$. Using solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we explore how galactic-scale observations can constrain $m$ and $λ$. We show that observational upper limits on the mass enclosed in central galactic regions can probe both attractive and repulsive self-interactions with strengths $λ\\sim \\pm 10^{-96} - 10^{-95}$. We further demonstrate that self-interactions can allow ULDM to describe observed rotation curves as well as satisfy an empirical soliton-halo mass relation in low surface brightness galaxies for $m \\sim 10^{-22}\\ \\text{eV}$ and $λ\\gtrsim 10^{-90}$. We also study tidal effects in satellite dwarf galaxies and find that attractive self-interactions can extend their lifetimes over cosmological timescales, allowing ULDM to evade recent constraints derived for the non-interacting case. Finally, we explore machine learning based inference of dark matter and baryonic parameters from galaxy rotation curves, showing that neural networks can recover parameters consistent with observations."}

These unique datasets will improve redshift estimation and provide a rich redshift catalog for the community. In this study, we forecast the performance of widely-used photometric redshift estimation methods using simulated SPHEREx and 7DS data. Four template-fitting approaches and two machine-learning (ML) methods are used to derive photometric redshifts from low-resolution spectrophotometric data. We measure redshifts using mock catalogs based on the GAMA and COSMOS galaxy samples and achieve high precision for bright (13 < i < 18) galaxies, with $σ_{NMAD}\\lesssim 0.005$, bias $\\lesssim 0.005$, and a catastrophic failure rate $\\lesssim 0.005$ for all methods employed. We find that the combined SPHEREx + 7DS dataset significantly improves redshift estimation compared to using either the SPHEREx or 7DS datasets alone, highlighting the synergy between the two surveys. Moreover, we compare the redshift estimation performance across magnitude ranges for the different methods and examine the probability distribution functions (PDFs) produced by the template-fitting approaches. As a result, we identify some factors that can affect the redshift measurements, like treatments on dust extinction or inclusion of flux uncertainty in the ML model. We also show that the PDFs are relatively well calibrated, although the confidence intervals are generally underestimated, particularly for bright galaxies in the template-fitting methods. This study demonstrates the strong potential of SPHEREx and 7DS to deliver improved redshift measurements from low-resolution spectrophotometric data, underscoring the scientific value of jointly utilizing both datasets."}

In watching the spectra vary it has been observed that the emission-lines often appear to \"reverberate\" -- that is they vary in response to continuum variations assumed to originate close to the black hole. This critical observation underlies the reverberation mapping technique, an elegant physics experiment that has allowed us to characterize the environment around many supermassive black holes in nearby active galactic nuclei. Recent observations are of such quality that the response can be measured as a function of velocity across the emission-line, and in doing so we can construct velocity-delay maps that show the structure and physics of the gas in the broad-line region better than any other measurement to date. Unfortunately constructing such maps requires a deconvolution, and given that the data are often noisy and with gaps such deconvolutions are non-trivial. Here we present a novel deconvolution method for the recovery of velocity-delay maps using a custom convolutional neural network architecture, showcasing that such methods have great promise for the deconvolution of reverberation mapping data products. While we have designed this new method with the BLR in mind, in principle this technique could be applied to any reverberation deconvolution problem, including in the accretion disk and torus."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We study the cosmological impact of a transient self-interaction phase in Ultra-Light Dark Matter (ULDM), focusing on its simultaneous effects on the sound horizon and the late-time growth of structure. In the presence of a quartic self-interaction, the scalar field undergoes a short-lived radiation-like phase before evolving into matter-like behaviour, inducing a localized modification of the expansion history at early times. We develop a perturbative and model-independent framework in which the self-interaction energy density is parametrized as a localized contribution to the total energy budget. Within this approach, the responses of the sound horizon and the linear growth factor can be expressed as weighted integrals over cosmic time, with distinct kernels encoding the temporal sensitivity of each observable. This structure leads to a simple analytic relation linking the corresponding early- and late-time responses, and naturally predicts correlated shifts in $H_0$ and $S_8$ whose sign and magnitude depend on the timing of the self-interaction episode. Our results show that a single transient modification of the expansion history can interpolate between early-time effects on the sound horizon and late-time suppression of structure growth within a unified physical framework, providing an analytical understanding of their joint response."}

Recently, FAST J0139+4328 was reported as the first isolated dark galaxy in the nearby universe, based on a neutral hydrogen (HI) detection and a non-detection in the Pan-STARRS1 survey. To verify the nature of this candidate, we obtained deep optical imaging, using the $1.4\\,\\mathrm{m}$ \\textit{Milanković} and $0.6\\,\\mathrm{m}$ \\textit{Nedeljković} telescopes, and spectroscopic follow-up of the field. We report the unambiguous discovery of a low-surface-brightness (LSB) optical counterpart at the location of the HI cloud. Furthermore, the detection of H$α$ emission via the $6\\,\\mathrm{m}$ Big Telescope Alt-Azimuthal (BTA) confirms that the stellar system lies at a redshift consistent with the HI source, establishing their physical association. Through detailed photometry and employing color-dependent mass-to-light scaling relations, we derive a total stellar mass of $M_\\star = (7.2 \\pm 3.7) \\times 10^6\\, M_{\\odot}$, about an order of magnitude higher than the previously estimated upper limit. Using the literature HI mass, this implies a gas-to-stellar mass ratio of $M_{\\mathrm{HI}} / M_{\\star} = 11.5 \\pm 6.4$. Our findings demonstrate that FAST J0139+4328 is not a dark galaxy but an extremely gas-rich LSB dwarf galaxy, whose stellar component was simply below the detection limit of the Pan-STARRS1 survey. This reclassification resolves the status of this prominent dark galaxy candidate and underscores the necessity of deep optical follow-up to classify faint HI-selected systems."}

The Leo A galaxy", "comment": "Paper accepted for publication on A&A. 17 pages, 14 figures, 5 appendices", "summary": "Study the ionized gas in metal-poor environments is key to understanding the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution. However, most of the previous studies of extragalactic HII regions rely on unresolved observations of gaseous structures. We study the south-western, spatially resolved, HII region of Leo A, one of the most studied isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. Using archival VIMOS-IFU/VLT data, we explored its gaseous structure through optical emission lines to gain insights into the present-day drivers of gas physics in this dIrr, and we place constraints on the chemical evolution scenario responsible for this low chemical enrichment. The emission line maps reveal that the strongest emission comes from the south-west region. A stratified distribution of ionic species was detected, likely powered by the young star cluster at the nebular centre. HST/ACS data show that the brightest star is in the centre of both the HII region and the star cluster. Photoionization production rates derived indicate that this star can sustain the ionization budget to power the HII region, although subject to the assumed electron density. Using the direct method, we derived a metallicity of $12+\\log(\\mathrm{O/H})=7.29\\pm0.06$ dex, increasing to $7.46\\pm0.09$ dex after correcting for temperature fluctuations, placing Leo A in the low-mass end of the MZR. Chemical evolution models suggest that, under constant accretion, the stellar mass growth and metal enrichment over the last 10 Gyr are successfully reproduced by both leaky-box and gas-regulator models. Those results are similar to those found in SagDIG, supporting a picture in which the present-day evolution of Leo A is dominated by stellar feedback processes. The combination of mass loss mechanisms and accretion events reproduces its chemical evolution, suggesting that Leo A has evolved under a gas equilibrium regime across its lifetime."}

The strength of the 2175 Å feature varies widely, including two sightlines where the bump is essentially absent.

We introduce a general effective collision term in the tracer Boltzmann equation to encode tracer dynamics that are intrinsically different from those of dark matter. This collision operator leads to modified continuity and Euler equations, with source terms reflecting the collision-term physics. At linear order, this framework predicts time- and scale-dependent bias parameters in a self-consistent manner, encompassing peak bias as a special case while clarifying how velocity bias and higher-derivative effects arise. Applying the resulting bias model to redshift-space distortions, we show that the Boltzmann-equation approach reproduces the power spectrum of biased tracers obtained in the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure up to $k^4$ terms with fewer independent parameters."}
