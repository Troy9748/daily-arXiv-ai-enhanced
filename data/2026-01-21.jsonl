Our emulators are constructed with the Aemulus $ν$ simulations, a suite of $wν$CDM $N$-body simulations with massive neutrinos as independent particle species. We combine small-scale analysis of clustering from $0.1h^{-1}$Mpc to $60.2~h^{-1}$Mpc and lensing from $1.7h^{-1}$Mpc to $60.2~h^{-1}$Mpc to perform cosmological constraints. We split the BOSS galaxies into three redshift bins to measure their clustering and employ galaxies from Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey and Hyper Suprime-Cam as source galaxies to measure lensing separately. We find that the addition of lensing significantly improves the constraining power on $S_{8}=σ_8(Ω_m/0.3)^{0.5}$, with a weak improvement for $fσ_{8}$. Our results of $fσ_{8}$ indicate tensions of around $1\\sim4σ$ below the results of CMB observations of Planck. For $S_{8}$, our results are also lower than Planck, and the tension can be mitigated when considering possible systematics in lensing measurement. As a byproduct, our analysis prefers a non-zero neutrino mass but without strong significance, with the constraining power dominated by the clustering. Given the accuracy and precision of our model and the observational data, it is anticipated that larger and higher-quality spectroscopic datasets will improve the constraints on this fundamental property in the near future."}

This work develops a mass inversion method tailored for upcoming space missions such as CSST and Euclid, aiming to recover both the mass distribution and the convergence power spectrum with high fidelity. We introduce MIU2Net, a versatile deep-learning framework for kappa-map reconstruction based on the U2-Net architecture. A new loss function is constructed to jointly estimate the convergence field and its frequency-domain energy distribution, effectively balancing optimal mean squared error and optimal power-spectrum recovery. The method incorporates realistic observational effects into shear fields, including shape noise, reduced shear, and complex masks. Under noise levels anticipated for future space-based lensing surveys, MIU2Net recovers the convergence power spectrum with 4% uncertainties up to l approximately 500, significantly outperforming Wiener filtering and MCALens. Beyond two-point statistics, the method accurately reconstructs the convergence distribution, peak centroid, and peak amplitude. Compared to other learning-based approaches such as DeepMass, MIU2Net reduces the root-mean-square error by 5% without smoothing and by 38% with a 1-arcmin smoothing scale. MIU2Net represents a substantial advancement in mass inversion methodology, offering improved accuracy in both RMSE and power-spectrum reconstruction. It provides a promising tool for mapping dark matter environments and large-scale structures in the era of next-generation space lensing surveys."}

This paper provides a rigorous theoretical treatment of the effect, deriving general expressions for the frequency shift within a lensing system embedded in a cosmological spacetime. Our formulation remains valid for arbitrary distances and velocities - including highly relativistic regimes - under any Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric.\n  Expanding upon previous papers on moving lenses, we provide a detailed analysis of frequency effects induced by lenses moving at relativistic speeds. Furthermore, we extend standard lensing theory by deriving an exact formula for the variation in the source's viewing direction. This result is of interest for strongly anisotropic emitters, such as compact binary systems emitting gravitational waves.

Abundances and chemical calibrators in molecular clouds", "comment": "Accepted to A&A", "summary": "The chemistry of shielded molecular gas is primarily driven by energetic, charged particles dubbed cosmic rays (CRs), in particular those with energies under 1 GeV. CRs ionize molecular hydrogen and helium, the latter of which contributes greatly to the destruction of molecules. CR ionization initiates a wide range of gas-phase chemistry, including pathways important for the so-called \"carbon cycle\", C$^+$/C/CO. Therefore, the CR ionization rate, $ζ$, is fundamental in theoretical and observational astrochemistry. Although observational methods show a wide range of ionization rates -- varying with the environment, especially decreasing into dense clouds -- astrochemical models often assume a constant rate. To address this limitation, we employ a post-processed gas-phase chemical model of a simulated dense molecular cloud that incorporates CR energy losses within the cloud. This approach allows us to investigate changes in abundance profiles of important chemical tracers and gas temperature. Furthermore, we analyze analytical calibrators for estimating $ζ$ in dense molecular gas that are robust when tested against a full chemical network. Additionally, we provide improved estimations of the electron fraction in dense gas for better consistency with observational data and theoretical calibrations for UV-shielded regions."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Observations of molecular structures on scales of $\\sim 0.1-50$ pc show that the specific angular momentum ($j$) scales with radius ($R$) as $j\\sim R^{3/2}$. We study the effects of turbulence, gravity, and the magnetic field in shaping this scaling, by measuring clump size and specific angular momentum in three SPH simulations of the formation of giant molecular clouds, progressively adding these three ingredients. In each simulation, we define ``full'' and ``reduced'' clump samples, the latter restricted to aspect ratios $A<3$. We find that, in the non-magnetic runs, elongated clumps deviate the most from the \\jR\\ relation, which is best reproduced by the reduced sample in the gravity+turbulence run. In the purely hydrodynamic case, no dense elongated structures form, suggesting that turbulence alone is insufficient to generate dense filaments, although clumps have $j$ magnitudes consistent with observations. In the gravity+turbulence+magnetic field run, most of the clumps are filamentary, yet the full sample appears to follow the observed \\jR\\ relation. This result, rather than being a real trend, could be the combination of the increase in $j$ by the filamentary geometry, and its reduction by turbulence inhibition by the magnetic field. Finally, we measure the gravitational, magnetic, pressure-gradient, and hydrodynamic torques (which involve turbulent viscosity) in our clump samples. We find that, in magnitude, the hydrodynamic torques tend to be larger than the rest. This result is consistent with our previous work, where we proposed that gravity drives cloud formation and contraction, while turbulence redistributes angular momentum through fluid-parcel exchanges."}

The profile shows a marked flattening beyond $\\sim$5 kpc, and is best fit by a two-component (Sersic + exponential) model, yielding a total stellar mass in old (age $>$1 Gyr) stars of $M_{\\star}=(6.7-8.1)\\times10^8 M_{\\odot}$. The origin of the outer stellar component is unclear. It may be accreted, even possibly associated with the counter-rotating HI gas in the outer regions of IC 10, or it may represent an ancient in-situ stellar halo. We tentatively detect two symmetric stellar overdensities at the edge of our imagery. These roughly align with the direction of IC 10's orbit around M31, suggesting that they may be signatures of tidal stripping.

(2) A tight inverse correlation between $f_{_{\\rm DM}}$ and baryon mass surface density ($Σ_{\\rm bar}$), with intrinsic scatter of $\\sim 0.11$ dex.

Each Petit--Bullet shows a distinct V-shaped structure in position--velocity space, reminiscent of the Y-shaped morphology of the Bullet, suggesting a common origin. These features are interpreted as the result of high-velocity plunges of compact gravitational objects into dense molecular gas. The spatial and kinematic properties of the Petit--Bullets suggest that the plunging material was not a single object but rather a small cluster of compact bodies. A virial mass of $1.0\\!\\times\\! 10^{5}\\, M_\\odot$ inferred from their velocity dispersion is comparable to that of typical globular clusters.

We find that the environment affects type~2 AGN and non-AGN galaxies in similar ways and does not impact the strength of AGN-driven outflows. The f$_{gas}$ of type~2 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies show no variation between group and isolated environments, suggesting that host galaxy gas content is largely independent of large-scale environment. We find that type~2 AGN host galaxies possess systematically lower f$_{gas}$ than their non-AGN counterparts when matched in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). This suggests that AGN activity plays a significant role in regulating the molecular gas reservoir and, consequently, the star formation processes within galaxies. We find that Type~2 AGNs exhibiting strong outflows are associated with higher gas fractions, higher star-formation rates, and younger stellar populations than those with weak or no outflows. This may indicate either concurrent star formation in gas-rich systems hosting powerful outflows, or a time delay between AGN activity and its effect on star formation consistent with a delayed AGN feedback scenario."}

In this work, we examine the angular correlation between the UGRB and the matter distribution traced by galaxies, using twelve years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations along with three years of Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We detect a correlation with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.96, primarily driven by large angular scales. We then perform a multi-tracer analysis that combines this measurement with the cross-correlation between $γ$ rays and DES weak lensing. The two single-tracer results are mutually consistent, and their combination yields a total significance of 8.6, firmly establishing the extragalactic origin of the UGRB. Intriguingly, the properties inferred for the sources contributing to the UGRB show departures from those of the resolved γ-ray population, suggesting that the faint end of the $γ$-ray sky is not a simple extrapolation of currently resolved sources."}

Using two high-resolution Hestia runs, we examine the distribution and velocities of H I, C IV, Si III, O VI, O VII, and O VIII and their imprints on sightlines observed from the Sun's location in different reference frames. To mimic observational strategies, we assess the contribution of rotating disc gas, assuming simple kinematic and geometrical considerations. Our results indicate that local absorption features in observed sightlines most likely trace material in the circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way. Some sightlines, however, show that intragroup material could be more easily observed towards the barycentre, which defines a preferred direction in the sky. In particular, H I, Si III, and C IV roughly trace cold gas inside the Milky Way and Andromeda haloes, as most of their mass flux occurs within the virial region of each galaxy, while oxygen high ions mostly trace hot halo and intragroup gas, with comparable mass fluxes in the Local Group outskirts and the circumgalactic medium of the two main galaxies. Additionally, we find that pressures traced by different ionic species outside the Milky Way halo show systematically higher values towards the barycentre direction in contrast to its antipode in the sky. Kinematic imprints of the global motion towards the barycentre can be seen at larger distances for all ionic species as the Milky Way rams into material in the direction of Andromeda, with gas towards the anti-barycentre lagging behind."}

Here, we examine the morphology of the magnetic fields in the G327.29 protocluster using both the velocity gradient technique (VGT) extracted from molecular line emissions and linear polarization in the dust continuum emission. The VGT analysis is performed using four molecular tracers: DCN (3-2), C18O (2-1), HN13C (3-2), and H13CO+ (3-2) - which probe gas across different density regimes, observed with the ALMA 12 m array. Owing to its sensitivity to gas dynamics, a comparison between VGT and dust polarization provides a powerful probe of the evolutionary processes in massive star-forming regions. From our analysis we reveal a complex magnetic-field structure, shaped by the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. In addition, it also appears that there is a large-scale (beyond the core scale) gravitational infall from the surrounding medium on to the filament and the central densest region.

Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics", "summary": "We present a new free-form lens model for the $z=0.348$ galaxy cluster AS1063, based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new images from the GLIMPSE program. We use the ultra-deep data to identify new counterimages for previously confirmed (spectroscopically) lensed systems. We use the full set of spectroscopically confirmed systems to derive a new lens model, which is later used to confirm many of the previous lensed system candidates and discover new lensed system candidates in the images. We compute the geometric redshifts, time delays, and magnification for all counterimages (confirmed and not confirmed). Among the new systems we find a peculiar multiply lensed galaxy with a strong emission line at $\\approx 4\\, μ$m that likely corresponds to H$-β$ and/or OIII at $z\\approx 7.5$. This galaxy could be a little-red-dot or an extreme emission line galaxy. We also identify a yellow supergiant lensed star candidate at $z\\approx 3.1$. This star shows some similarities with previous Kaiju stars and we nickname it \"Hedorah\", in honor of the famous yellow-eyed Kaiju. Previous lensed stars at $z>0.1$ are either blue supergiants or red supergiants, making Hedorah the first yellow supergiant discovered beyond $z=0.1$ and confirming that, despite their rarity, they can also be found at these redshifts. Since many Cepheid stars are yellow supergiants, we consider the possibility that Hedorah could also be the first Cepheid discovered at cosmological distances, but we conclude that Hedorah is more likely a hypergiant yellow star approaching the end of its life. Alternatively, Hedorah could be a small group of stars, although this is less likely based on Hedorah's peculiar colors and additionally may require the more exotic fuzzy dark matter to help explain the lack of counterimage."}

We examine the signature of the transition as traced through the redshifted 21-cm line with SKA-Low at $3 < z < 7$. To do so, we use the semi-numerical simulation \\textsc{21cmFAST} to model the HI during the EoR and add a HI-halo based post-processing model of the late-time HI. This approach gives a robust estimate of the amplitude of the HI temperature field and predicts the observable power spectrum during the transition period. We find that our simulation pipeline reproduces the expected power spectrum trends from existing observations and theory, in addition to replicating current observational constraints on $Ω_{\\text{HI}}$. Our simulations predict a drop in power of four orders of magnitude between $4 < z < 7$. Assuming an inhomogeneous recombination model, we find a flattening of the power due to lingering neutral islands masking the late-time HI signal for $5 < z< 6.5$. Using SKA-Low deep survey parameters, we find HI power spectrum detectability at scales $k \\leq 1$ $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for redshifts $3< z < 7$, even when using the horizon limit to mitigate foregrounds. Our results suggest a sufficient SNR of the HI power spectrum tracing the underlying halos $z < 5$, which can be used for late-time cosmology. Our results suggest that the resulting $Ω_{\\rm HI}$ constraints can trace different reionization scenarios such as a decreased escape fraction. This study implies that deep SKA-Low observations for $3< z< 7$ will be an important probe to constrain reionization parameters as well as cosmological models."}

The Chern-Simons coupling between the scalar field in early dark energy (EDE) models and CMB photons is regarded as a plausible mechanism for generating cosmic birefringence. Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) deliver $EB$ measurements at higher multipole moments than those previously achieved by {Planck}, while DESI and PantheonPlus datasets provide new and stringent constraints on the late-time expansion history. Using a joint analysis of {Planck}, DESI DR1, Pantheon+, and ACT data, we perform a full-parameter constraint on the cosmic birefringence effects induced by the EDE-CMB photon coupling.

Using the reduced inertia tensor (r-TOI), we followed the anisotropic evolution of initially spherical Lagrangian volumes (LVs) centred at galaxy formation sites, both in dark matter (DM) and in cold baryons (CB), from very high redshift $z=15$ onward. We describe LV deformation in terms of the r-TOI eigen-directions, principal axes, their derived shape parameters, and the timescales for the freezing-out of these principal directions and axes. Of particular interest are the age of the Universe, $t_{\\rm U}$, when the local Cosmic Web (CW) spine emerges, and that when anisotropic DM mass arrangements (i.e., migrant mass flows) cease. We find that the shapes LVs acquire along their evolution affect the halo and stellar mass of their central galaxy: prolate-shaped LVs show a tendency to host low-mass galaxies at $z=0$, while massive galaxies tend to form within triaxial or oblate LVs. Also, the local CW spine tends to set in earlier on in LVs that are to host massive galaxies than in those harbouring less massive galaxies. In addition, anisotropic DM-mass rearrangements stop late on average, at $t_{\\rm U}\\sim 10.5\\,$Gyr, and even slightly later for CB. Interestingly, $z=0$ LVs with either flattened configurations in CB or those that are highly prolate in DM, are more likely to host rotation-dominated galaxies. This effect increases from $z=1$ to $z=0$. Finally, the CB spine of LVs that are more likely to host rotation-dominated galaxies emerges at later times."}

We update an analytical cusp-core transition model by incorporating the effect of supernova-driven mass loss. Adapting this model to SPARC galaxies, we measure the energy conversion efficiency epsilon, defined as the fraction of supernova feedback energy that is used to change the central dark-matter potential. We find epsilon ~ 0.01 for nearby SPARC galaxies. Building on these measurements, we compare the dynamical energy required for a cusp-core transformation with the feedback energy available over burst cycles and identify a cusp-core transition forbidden region on the halo-stellar mass plane where transformation cannot occur. Galaxies with halo masses from 10^8 to 10^11 M_sun lie outside the forbidden region, whereas ultra-faint dwarf galaxies < 10^8 M_sun, galaxy groups and clusters > 10^11 M_sun fall within it, consistent with their high central densities and the inefficiency of core formation at very low and very high masses. This approach also explains the observed diversity of inner density profiles in low-mass systems, showing that both the star formation rate and the energy conversion efficiency govern them, with the latter emerging as a key parameter setting the strength of the cusp-core transition. Beyond the cusp-core problem, our observationally inferred energy conversion efficiency provides a model independent benchmark that strongly constrains galaxy formation models."}

The improved spatial resolution of the VLA data allow us to identify a faint optical counterpart and characterize the galaxy. Located at a distance of about 31 Mpc, J0139+4328 has a stellar mass of 3 x 10^6 M_Sun and a relatively high gas richness of M_HI/M_star = 18. Despite its high ratio, the galaxy is consistent, within the scatter, with the stellar-to-HI mass relation of HI-selected samples in the literature and with the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), although its kinematic measurement is subject to large uncertainties. This case highlights the potential of modern high-sensitivity HI surveys for detecting low surface brightness, gas-rich galaxies, but underscores the need for careful interpretation of low-resolution HI data, with potentially large centroid errors, and for sufficiently deep optical imaging to ensure robust identification."}

Applying these calibrations to 460 radio observations of Galactic HII~regions spanning Galactocentric distances from $\\sim0.1$ to 16 kpc, we determine the radial O/H gradient in the Milky Way under both assumptions. We further compare these nebular gradients to independent metallicity estimates from young O- and B-type stars and Cepheid variables.

Comments are welcome. 14 pages, 16 plot", "summary": "Context. In the Local Group, dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) exhibit large velocity dispersions. These values are generally attributed to the presence of substantial amounts of dark matter (DM), in line with the predictions of the standard model of galaxy formation. However, alternative, more conservative explanations exist, such as non-virialized dynamical states induced by tidal interactions, the presence of stellar streams, and artificial inflation of the velocity dispersion caused by binary-star orbital motion. Aims. We study the dynamical evolution of UFDs using purely stellar (\"dry\") dynamics, without invoking DM. We dynamically evolve our systems up to a Hubble time and compare our results with observational studies and previous theoretical work. Methods. We employ direct high precision NBODY simulations performed with the NBODY6++GPU code. We explore the role of binaries in inflating the velocity dispersion of low-mass host galaxies. We also present both the stellar and dynamical evolution of the stellar population, which is necessary to properly interpret our results. Results. We find that, in all our models, the UFD remains globally quasi-stationary for approximately 3000 Myr. Subsequently, the system undergoes mass segregation and experiences a phase resembling core collapse. Red giants and white dwarfs (WD) are found to play significant, but distinct, roles. Red giants provide the dominant contribution to the luminosity, whereas WDs constitute the largest fraction of the non-luminous component, accounting for approximately 13% of the total stellar population. Finally, if not taken into account properly, velocity dispersion measurements can be strongly biased by the presence of a significant binary population, which can lead to substantial overestimates of velocity dispersion in UFDs"}

Accepted by AJ", "summary": "Using new Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30m telescope $\\rm N_2H^+$, $\\rm C^{18}O$ $J$=1-0 and Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope $\\rm ^{13}CO$ and $\\rm C^{18}O$ $J$=2-1 maps together with archival far-infrared continuum data, and $\\rm ^{12}CO$, and $\\rm ^{13}CO$ $J$=1-0 data, we present a comprehensive analysis of the massive filament CFG024.00$+$0.48 (G24) across clump-to-cloud scales. Our results show that G24 is an $\\sim$80 pc giant filament with a total mass of $\\sim$$10^5$ M$_{\\odot}$. In the different tracers the filament width is measured to be about $\\sim$2 times the beam size of the observations, as expected for power-law density distributions, giving beam-deconvolved widths in the range from 0.8 to 2.8 pc. We determine a line-of-sight thickness of $\\sim$2.2 pc demonstrating that G24 is not an edge-on, flatten structure. The virial parameter obtained from line mass ($α_{\\rm line,vir}=M_{\\rm line,vir}/M_{\\rm line}$) from the $\\rm C^{18}O$ (1-0) data is 0.85, and that obtained from $Herschel$-based H$_2$ column density is 0.52, suggesting G24 is globally close to virial equilibrium. The distribution of the 40 dust clumps appears to have a ''two-tier'' fragmentation pattern. For the clump groups, the separation, with a mean/median of 3.68/3.46 pc, is very close to expected length associated with the maximum fragmentation growth rate of $λ_{\\rm max}=3.55 \\pm0.32$ pc estimated for the dust. However, the longitudinal centroid velocity profiles of $\\rm C^{18}O$ and $\\rm N_2H^+$ show oscillation patterns with wavelengths of 9.8$\\pm$0.1 pc and 9.9$\\pm$0.1 pc, respectively. This is $\\sim$2 times larger than the corresponding values of $λ_{\\rm max}$ of 4.96$\\pm$0.63 pc and 4.65$\\pm$1.34 pc, respectively. This suggests that the velocity structure is not dominated by flows directly associated with the fragmentation seen in the dust emission."}

We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data of one such system, the dwarf galaxy Canes Venatici C (CVn C). CVn C is a low-mass (3.4(+4.2-2.6)*10^6 M_sun) galaxy with a Tip of the Red Giant Branch distance of 8.43(+0.47-0.32) Mpc determined from the resolved stars in the HST imaging, which we also use to derive CVn C's structural parameters. CVn C's distance places CVn C in the Local Volume and in an isolated environment with the most tidally influential L* galaxy > 5Rvir away. Additional constraints from the HST color-magnitude diagram, archival Far-Ultraviolet (FUV), and neutral hydrogen (HI) data show that CVn C is quenched, with no evidence of star formation in the last 100 Myr and no detectable gas (MHI < 1.5*10^6 M_sun). Circumstantial evidence suggests that CVn C may have quenched via past interactions with the L* galaxy NGC 4631 (L_K = 10^10.4 L_sun), and was possibly sent on an extreme backsplash orbit by the tidal dissolution of a subhalo group. However, other quenching mechanisms-such as stripping via the cosmic web-cannot be ruled out. CVn C adds to the growing number of quenched dwarf galaxies in under-dense environments, a population that will be critical to defining the mass and environment regimes in which different quenching mechanisms operate."}

As giant radio galaxies (GRGs) often extend to the scale of entire galaxy clusters ($\\sim$Mpc) and beyond, they are a suitable class of objects for studying jet--intracluster medium interactions. This paper presents a multiwavelength study of a GRG, J1007+3540, using the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey second data release (LoTSS DR2) at 144 MHz and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at 400 MHz. The source has a projected linear extension of 1.45 Mpc and is hosted by MaxBCG J151.77665+35.67813, within the WHL 100706.4+354041 cluster. At both frequencies, the source exhibits clear signatures of recurrent jet activity, a one-sided, extended, tail-like diffuse structure with a morphological break in the tail. The estimated radiative ages of the inner lobes and outer north lobe are $\\sim$140 Myr and $\\sim$240 Myr, respectively. In addition to the radio analysis, we performed optical--to--infrared spectral energy distribution modelling. The host galaxy is an evolved elliptical system with a stellar mass of $\\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot) = 11.0$ and an old stellar population age of $\\sim$12 Gyr. The high infrared-derived star formation rate ($\\sim106~M_\\odot$~yr$^{-1}$) of the source implies significant dust-obscured star formation, potentially linked to merger-driven gas inflows. J1007+3540 presents a rare combination of a restarted jet, a detached tail-like structure, and unusual spectral flattening beyond the tail break, which is very rare to report together in a GRG. This rare and remarkable system offers a unique laboratory for probing the interplay between active galactic nucleus activity, star formation, and environmental effects in cluster-surrounded GRGs."}
