This framework naturally links the dark and visible matter abundances ($Ω_{\\rm DM} \\sim Ω_{\\rm visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry where dark matter is composed of matter AQNs and antimatter AQNs. Although behaving as cold dark matter on cosmological scales, baryons annihilate with antimatter AQNs, producing ionizing high-energy photons. The resulting energy injection may imprint spectral distortions on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and modify the reionization history. Using a modified version of the \\texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code we compute the impact of this energy injection on the $μ$ and $y$ spectral distortion parameters as well as on the optical depth. We find that (1) the CMB anisotropies remain essentially unaffected by baryon annihilation, and (2) the associated spectral distortion signatures lie within the sensitivity reach of proposed CMB spectral distortion missions. Finally, we discuss the similarities and differences between the AQN scenario and annihilating or decaying dark matter models."}

The main absorption-amplifying effect is the earlier birth of the first stars forming an ultraviolet radiation background. This radiation reduces the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen and, thus, amplifies the absorption in the 21 cm line. A comparison of various cosmological models (with and without a bump in the density perturbation spectrum) shows that it is possible to determine the probable position of the bump in the perturbation spectrum and, thus, to reconstruct the spectrum of cosmological perturbations on scales $k>1$~Mpc${}^{-1}$ from the position of the absorption frequency profile."}

On scales below the nDGP crossover scale $r_{\\rm c}$, the nDGP model features an effective gravity-like fifth force that alters the growth of structure, leading to an enhancement of the halo mass function (HMF) on cluster scales. The enhanced cluster abundance allows for constraints on the nDGP model using cluster samples. We employ the SPT cluster sample, selected through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZE) with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and with mass calibration using weak-lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The cluster sample contains 1,005 clusters with redshifts $0.25 < z < 1.78$, which are confirmed with the Multi-Component Matched Filter (MCMF) algorithm using optical and near-infrared data. Weak-lensing data from DES and HST enable a robust mass measurement of the cluster sample. We use DES Year 3 data for 688 clusters with redshifts $z < 0.95$, and HST data for 39 clusters with redshifts $ 0.6 < z <1.7$. We account for the enhancement in the HMF through a semi-analytic correction factor to the $νΛ$CDM HMF derived from the spherical collapse model in the nDGP model. We then further calibrate this model using $N$-body simulations. In addition, for the first time, we analyze the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from Planck PR4 within the nDGP model. We obtain a competitive constraint from the joint analysis of the SPT cluster abundance with the Planck PR4 data, and report an upper bound of $1/\\sqrt{H_0r_{\\rm c}}< 1.41$ at $95\\%$ when assuming a cosmology with massive neutrinos."}

Many sources exhibit polarization signatures consistent with aligned dust grains, yet the physical origin of this alignment remains uncertain. One such source is BHB07-11, a Class I protobinary object in the Pipe Nebula with complex spiral arm structures in its circumbinary disk. While magnetic fields are often invoked to explain grain alignment in the interstellar medium, the contrasting conditions in circumstellar disk environments demand further investigation into grain alignment mechanisms. To determine BHB07-11's dominant polarization mechanism, we leverage ALMA polarization-mode dust continuum observations in Bands 3 ($λ$=3.1 mm), 6 ($λ$=1.3 mm), and 7 ($λ$=0.87 mm), in combination with high-resolution dust continuum and spectral line observations in Band 6. Observed polarization vectors in each band are consistent with emission from aligned grains and follow the structure of the spiral arms as shown in the high-resolution observations. Given the relationship between the observed polarization vector orientation and the spiral arms, we find that the polarization morphology is most consistent with grains aligned through a relative velocity flow between gas and dust in the spiral arms, as envisioned in the recently developed badminton birdie-like alignment mechanism, rather than alignment with a magnetic field or other known alignment mechanisms."}

The spatial distribution of dense cores during the evolution of cluster-forming massive clump", "comment": "32 pages, 22 figures, accepted for publication in the Astronomy & Astrophysics journal, abstract adapted from current version", "summary": "High-mass stars and star clusters form from the fragmentation of massive dense clumps driven by gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. The ALMAGAL project observed $\\sim1000$ clumps at $\\sim$1000\\,au resolution, enabling a statistically significant characterization of this process across a large range of clump physical parameters and evolutionary stages. In this work, we investigated the spatial distribution of dense cores in the 514 massive, potentially cluster-forming, clumps hosting at least 4 cores, to trace fragmentation's initial conditions and early evolution. We used quantitative descriptors, evaluated against the clump bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio as an indicator of evolution. Core separations were measured with the minimum spanning tree method (MST) and compared with the Jeans gravitational fragmentation theory. We used the $Q$ parameter and the mass segregation ratio, $Λ_{MSR}$, to evaluate whether cores have specific arrangements or differences depending on their masses. ALMAGAL cores are usually arranged in elliptical groups with an axis ratio $e\\sim2.2$, but $e\\geq$5 is also observed. A single characteristic core separation per clump is found in $\\sim76$% of cases, but signatures of multiple fragmentation lengths not rare. Typical core separations are compatible with the clump-averaged thermal Jeans length, $λ^{th}_{J}$, though a population, typical of low-fragmented/young clumps, has wider separations with $l\\approx3\\timesλ^{th}_{J}$. The core separation decreases on average from $l\\sim22000$ au in younger systems to $l\\sim7000$ au in more evolved ones. Cores are typically distributed in fractal-type subclusters, with centrally concentrated patterns appearing only at later stages, but without a progressive evolutionary transition. Finally, mass segregation is found in 110 systems, with its occurrence increasing with evolution."}

This step induces a brief phase of ultra-slow-roll inflation, producing the large enhancement of the scalar power spectrum required for an appreciable amount of PBH abundance. Instead of the commonly used analytical power spectra, we compute the primordial power spectrum accurately by numerically solving the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation. Using the obtained power spectrum, we apply peak theory with $\\nabla^2 ζ$ treated as a Gaussian random field and parametrize the curvature profile by its amplitude $μ$ and characteristic width $K$. Confining the study to Type-I PBH, the threshold value is calculated using two robust methods: the average of the compaction function and the q-function method. Using the result, the dimensionless spin parameter of the resulting PBHs is calculated at linear order and found to be $\\sqrt{\\langle a_\\star^2 \\rangle} \\sim 10^{-3}$; however, it can be higher for smaller masses. We present detailed predictions for two representative parameter sets, calculate the present-day PBH mass function $f_{\\rm PBH}(M)$ and the associated scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW).

But few such sources have been confirmed at z>4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R~2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity (~0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy."}

When dark sector EoS are fixed to $w_{\\mathrm{de}}=-1$ and $w_{\\mathrm{dm}}=0$, the data consistently favor an energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter across various interaction forms. This apparent evidence, however, proves highly sensitive to the EoS assumptions: treating $w_{\\mathrm{de}}$ as a free parameter substantially weakens the evidence for interaction, with its value converging to the quintessence regime ($w_{\\mathrm{de}}>-1$). In contrast, freeing $w_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ maintains a preference for interaction, revealing a correlation where positive $w_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ is associated with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, and negative $w_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ with energy transfer from dark matter to dark energy. These findings caution against the simplistic assumption of $Λ$CDM EoS values when attempting to detect a possible interaction. Despite these fundamental degeneracies, model comparison using the Akaike and Deviance information criteria shows that all of the tested interacting dark energy scenarios receive substantial support over the $Λ$CDM model."}

Building on a generalised Press & Schechter model and triaxial collapse (GPS+), we predict the HMF in terms of the variance of the linear density field, with only a weak explicit dependence on halo mass and no explicit dependence on redshift. The GPS+ model naturally provides the correct normalization and high-mass behaviour without requiring empirical fitting. We calibrate and validate the GPS+ model using the Uchuu N-body simulation suite, which combines large cosmological volume and high mass resolution under Planck cosmology. Using six simulations with up to 300 realizations, we obtain precision HMF measurements spanning halo masses in the range 6.5 < log($M_{\\rm 200m}$/[h$^{-1}$ $M_{\\odot}$]) <16 over 0 < z < 20, with reduced cosmic variance. Across this full domain, the GPS+ model reproduces the simulated HMF with deviations typically below 10-20%. Comparison with the Sheth-Tormen (ST) model shows similar performance at z < 2, but markedly improved agreement at higher redshifts, where ST can deviate by 70-80% while our model remains within ~20%. Finally, we assess the impact of the halo mass definition: adopting the evolving virial overdensity of Bryan & Norman (1998) worsens agreement at low redshift and high masses, whereas M200m yields a more universal, nearly redshift-independent HMF."}
