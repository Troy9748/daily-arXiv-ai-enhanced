We present a novel accretion disc-based sub-grid model for BH mass and spin evolution in the super-Eddington regime, implemented in the hydrodynamics code GIZMO. In our model, motivated by results of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of accretion discs, the growth of the BH is mediated by a sub-grid accretion disc, comprising an inner photon-trapping region described by simulation-based fitting formulae and an outer thin $α$-disc with three regions. We incorporate a self-consistent spin evolution prescription that transitions between the Bardeen-Petterson effect and inner thick-disc precession, depending on the accretion rate. We perform a suite of idealised simulations of a BH embedded in a gaseous circumnuclear disc and a spherically distributed stellar component to explore the conditions under which super-Eddington accretion can be sustained in the environment of a realistic galactic nucleus. Simulations with misaligned gas inflows onto an initially aligned BH-disc system yield very high Eddington ratios, triggered by the rapid removal of disc angular momentum via inflows. These results highlight the importance of angular momentum misalignment in enabling super-Eddington accretion and suggest that such episodes are difficult to trigger unless the system resides in a highly dynamical environment -- a condition more likely to occur in high-redshift galaxies. Our model potentially provides a way to grow moderate-mass BH seeds to the sizes required to explain the bright high-redshift quasars."}

Near-infrared Data Release 3: A Spectral Atlas and Characterization of AGN", "comment": "27 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series", "summary": "We present an analysis of near-infrared (NIR) emission-line properties, AGN diagnostics, and circumnuclear gas dynamics for 453 hard X-ray selected (14$-$195 keV) AGN from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) NIR Data Release 3 (DR3; $\\langle z \\rangle=0.036$, $z<1.0$). This dataset is the largest compilation of rest-frame NIR spectroscopic observations of hard-X-ray-selected AGN and includes the full DR2 sample. Observations were obtained with VLT X-shooter, a multiwavelength (0.3$-$2.5$μ$m) spectrograph ($R$ = 4,000$-$18,000), using a $\\geq 2 σ$ detection threshold, enabling broad analysis of emission features. We find that NIR coronal lines, particularly SiVI $\\lambda1.964$, are more reliable tracers of AGN luminosity than optical [OIII], showing a tighter correlation with hard X-ray luminosity ($σ=0.25$dex) than [OIII] $\\lambda5007$ ($σ=0.55$dex). Broad Paschen lines (Pa$α$ and Pa$β$) are detected in 12% of Seyfert 2 and 57% of Seyfert 1.9, consistent with previous hidden BLR studies. We introduce a refined NIR diagnostic diagram (FeII $\\lambda1.257$$μ$m/Pa$β$ and H$_2$ $λ2.122$$μ$m/Br$γ$) that effectively distinguishes AGN, star-forming, and composite sources even when contamination limits individual diagnostics or only upper limits are available. Additionally, we find a moderate correlation ($p \\approx 7.4 \\times 10^{-3}$) between hot molecular gas mass (traced by H$_2$ 2.121$μ$m) and X-ray luminosity, while its relation with Eddington ratio is weaker. The hot-to-cold gas mass ratio spans four orders of magnitude, averaging $\\sim 3 \\times 10^{-7}$, indicating diverse molecular gas excitation processes likely driven by star formation and AGN feedback. Our results underscore the value of NIR spectroscopy in probing AGN activity, obscured BLRs, and the complex interactions between AGN and their circumnuclear environments."}
