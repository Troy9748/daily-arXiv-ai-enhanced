In order to discuss the physical origins of these variations, we incorporate gas- and dust-phase interstellar chemistry into galaxy-scale simulations with various baryonic physics including dust formation, evolution, and destruction, all of which are essential for the calculations of 400 interstellar molecule species. The new simulations can accordingly predict the abundances of gas- and ice-phase molecular species such as H_2O and CO_2 ice within individual molecular gas cloud of galaxies based on gas density and temperature, dust temperature (T_dust), elemental abundances (e.g., CHNOPS), UV radiation strength (F_UV), and cosmic ray ionisation rate (zeta_CR) within the clouds. Since this is the first of the series of papers, we describe the details of the new simulations and present the preliminary results focused on the spatial distributions of H_2O, CO, CO_2, and CH_3OH ice species in a disk galaxy similar to the Milky Way. We particularly discuss how T_dust and gas-phase elemental abundances can control the spatial distributions of the above molecules in galaxies. We briefly discuss the total amount of H_2O and CO_2 ices and radial distributions of PN and PO molecules in the Galaxy."}

Our knowledge of the dust properties is nevertheless incomplete, especially regarding the dense star-forming clouds. The aim is to study dust evolution in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) and how uncertainty regarding dust properties affects estimates of the radiation field and the cloud mass. We constructed three-dimensional radiative transfer (RT) models to fit the far-infrared (FIR) observations of dust emission in the OMC-3 field and used near-infrared (NIR) extinction measurements as additional constraints. We examined fits to the dense star-forming filaments and to the surrounding cloud, including some tests with spatial dust property variations.The 160-250 $μ$m observations of dust emission could be fitted moderately well with any of the dust models tested, but few models are consistent with the measured NIR extinction. The best match to observations is found with dust models such as the THEMIS model of large porous grains, with or without ice mantles, and with mean grain sizes up to ~ 0.3$μ$m. The flattening of the NIR extinction curve excludes larger grain sizes, except possibly in the central ridge. Compared to models of lower column density clouds, the results were relatively insensitive to the line-of-sight (LOS) cloud size and the spectral shape of the heating radiation field. In addition, the effect of embedded stars remained very localised in OMC-3. The results suggest that the dust in the OMC-3 region is evolved with a grain of average size $a$=0.1-0.3 $μ$m, potentially with ice mantles."}

The hadronic matter equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field approach, constrained by chiral effective field theory ($χ$EFT) calculations at low densities, finite nuclei and heavy-ion collision data at intermediate densities, and neutron star (NS) observations at high densities. For the dark sector, we consider fermionic dark matter (FDM) interacting via a dark vector meson, and two bosonic dark matter models (BDM1 and BDM2) characterized by self-interacting scalar fields. Bayesian inference is employed to constrain the model parameters, including the dark matter mass, coupling strength, and dark matter fraction within NSs. Our analysis finds that all models yield consistent nuclear matter parameters, allowing a small dark matter fraction under 10%. The presence of dark matter slightly softens the EoS, leading to a modest reduction in NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability, though all models remain compatible with NICER and GW170817 observations. The log-evidence and likelihood analyses reveal no statistical preference among the FDM and BDM models, indicating that current astrophysical data cannot decisively distinguish between fermionic and bosonic dark matter scenarios. This study provides a unified statistical framework to constrain dark matter properties using NS observables."}

The method combines $E$ and $B$ modes with inverse-variance weights, to yield an unbiased reconstruction of $m(\\boldsymbolθ)$ to first order. We study the ability of future Stage IV surveys to obtain an unbiased reconstruction of the $m$-bias in differing scenarios, considering differing bias morphologies, and characteristic scales, as well as differing metrics to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed map. Considering an $m$ pattern repeating on $\\sim 1^\\circ\\times1^\\circ$ sky patches, as might be the case for an $m$ field caused by focal-plane systematics. With a Euclid-like redshift distribution, we find that $\\sim5\\%$ rms variations in $m$-bias may be detected at the 20$σ$ level, after stacking between $\\sim400$ and $\\sim1000$ patches (rising to between $\\sim2800$ and $\\sim7600$ for $1\\%$ rms variations, data volumes that are becoming available with upcoming surveys), depending on the morphology of the $m$ pattern. We show that these results are robust against the cosmological model assumed in the reconstruction, as well as the presence of intrinsic alignments or baryonic effects, and that the method shows no spurious response to additive ($c-$) bias. These results demonstrate that percent-level, spatially-varying $m-$bias can be detected at high significance, enabling diagnosis and mitigation in the Stage IV weak lensing era."}

Prior-driven deblending techniques require extensive fine-tuning and struggle to process large fields. This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique. We employ a transformer neural network to improve the resolution of Herschel/SPIRE 500 $μ$m observations by a factor 4.5, using Spitzer/MIPS 24$μ$m and Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350, 500$μ$m images. Trained on SIDES and SHARK simulations, we injected instrumental noise into the input simulated images, while keeping the target images noise-free to enhance de-noising capabilities of our method.\n  We evaluated the performance on simulated test sets and real JCMT/SCUBA-2 450 $μ$m observations in the COSMOS field which have superior resolution compared to Herschel. Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images. Astrometric error is low ($\\lesssim$ 1\" vs 12\" pixel scale). Reliability is $\\gtrsim$ 90% for sources $>$3 mJy and $>$90% of sources with intrinsic fluxes $\\gtrsim5$ mJy are recovered. Applied to real 500 $μ$m observations, fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved map agree well with SCUBA-2 measured fluxes for sources $\\geq$10 mJy.

To investigate the nature of compact continuum sources that have been previously identified in this region, we analyzed 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular line emission. The central millimeter peak MM1 coincides with the centimeter source VLA 2, has a complex molecular spectrum, and is identified as a hot molecular core. Molecular emission of SiO and CH3CN in the vicinity of MM1 reveals kinematics consistent with wide-angle outflow structures and a possible rotating disk in the source. VLA sources 1A, 1B, and 3 are lacking compact millimeter counterparts and trace shocked regions where the outflow interacts with the surrounding material. In particular, VLA 1A, the site of H2O maser super flares, is interpreted as a shock interface that exhibits developed turbulent movements seen in the SiO molecular line. The observed turbulence creates conditions required for H2O maser action, directly linking the nature of VLA 1A to the origin of the H2O maser super flares."}

These observations reveal previously unexplored properties of dual and lensed systems, key to understanding galaxy evolution, black hole mergers, and strong-lensing modeling. Targets were selected using the Gaia Multi-Peak (GMP) technique, which identifies pairs of point-like sources with separations below 0.8\" in the Gaia catalog. MUSE spatially resolved spectroscopy provides redshifts, ionization diagnostics, and absorption systems along the line of sight. We report results for 30 GMP-selected targets at z=0.5-3.5. All systems show at least two spatially resolved components. Nineteen objects are confirmed as AGN multiplets, including 6 dual AGN, 10 doubly-lensed quasars, and 3 quadruply-lensed systems, while the remaining 11 correspond to alignments with foreground stars. Among spectroscopically confirmed dual AGN in the literature, 24 pairs have separations below 7 kpc, and our sample accounts for 25% of them. We study dual and lensed AGN distributions as a function of redshift, magnitude, and projected separation, and find that bright systems (J<16.5) are dominated by lensed quasars, whereas the fraction of dual AGN increases at fainter magnitudes. This first-year sample demonstrates the high efficiency of GMP pre-selection combined with MUSE spectroscopy. The full program, targeting 150 systems, will enable statistical studies of dual AGN incidence and detailed constraints on mass distribution in strong-lensing galaxies."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Circumbinary disks crucially affect the orbital and electromagnetic properties of binary systems across the universe, from stars in our galactic neighborhood to supermassive black hole binaries formed as the result of tumultuous galactic mergers. Previous simulations have focused nearly exclusively on thick accretion disks, appropriate for studying stellar binaries, and have found encouraging agreement with observations thereof. We present herein the first systematic study of eccentric binary systems accreting from thin disks, focusing on binary orbital evolution. Our main results are that (1) thinner disk not only drive binaries to rapidly inspiral, but also excite binary eccentricities at much higher rates; (2) while thick disks may drive binaries to a stable fixed point of $e\\approx0.425$, thinner disks pump binary eccentricities to $e\\gtrsim0.6$; (3) the range of near-zero eccentricities that are damped towards zero depends on both disk thickness and viscosity, thinner disks and those with $α$ viscosities driving binaries towards circularity over a much narrower range of eccentricities. These differences follow largely from the effects of pressure support on accretion streams and shocks within the inner regions of the accretion flow. Our results suggest that accreting binary black holes should have high eccentricities well into the frequency range probed by pulsar timing arrays and space-based gravitational wave interferometers, affecting the spectrum and isotropy of the gravitational wave background. Our results also suggest that circumbinary disks may play an important role in shaping the orbits of close binary stars, but much less so those of wider binaries."}

To remove systematics caused by stellar mass (M*) and star formation rate (SFR), we construct stacked spectra binned by redshift within fixed M* and SFR ranges, as well as across the full ranges. We find that the [OII]3727/Hb ratio drops by a factor of five from z~3 to 8 at fixed M* and SFR, in contrast to the nearly constant [OIII]5007/Hb ratio. We derive metallicities via the direct Te method using the [OIII]4363 line, and identify that high-z galaxies lie on the low-metallicity end of the anti-correlation between ionization parameter and metallicity at z~0. Photoionization modeling demonstrates that the redshift evolution, where metallicity decreases and ionization parameter increases, self-consistently explains the observed line ratios. We then examine the mass-metallicity (MZ) and fundamental (MZ-SFR) relations. Including additional galaxies at z~10-12, we find that the MZ relation monotonically decreases from z~3 to 10 at fixed M*, while the MZ-SFR relation shows a significant decline at z>8. Based on the ChemicalUniverseMachine model, this evolutionary trend can be explained by enhanced gas inflow (outflow) by a factor of ~5 (~1.7) at z>8."}

Under the latter scenario, the observed $b_{\\rm OVI}$-$N_{\\rm OVI}$ relation maps directly to a velocity-size relation consistent with a Kolmogorov-like turbulent spectrum. Together, these findings reveal a coherent physical picture in which H I and O VI trace a continuous turbulent cascade spanning more than five orders of magnitude in spatial scale-from cool, photoionized clumps to warm, highly ionized halo gas--with accretion in the halo outskirts likely driving the turbulent energy injection that sustains the multiphase CGM."}

We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} > 10^8 M_{\\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z < 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ due to scatter.

The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field.

The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics.

There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\\mathbf{g}|\\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations."}

We test this interpretation by performing a non-parametric exploration of the minimally coupled, luminal Horndeski subclass known as kinetic gravity braiding (KGB). Using mochi_class and its manifestly stable effective field theory (EFT) basis implementation, we efficiently scan a broad class of models in which the EFT functions are allowed to vary freely in time, while enforcing the absence of ghost and gradient instabilities from the outset. We identify a set of KGB models that realize phantom crossing and remain broadly consistent with current probes of the background and linear large-scale structure, including CMB temperature and lensing power spectra, redshift-space distortions, cosmic shear, and the cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect.

Periodicities may originate from different physical processes, including the intermittent gas feeding of the black holes caused by the time-varying non-axisymmetric binary potential, the Doppler boosting of the flux emitted by individual accretion discs bound to the orbiting BHs, and the gravitational lensing of the accretion disc of one black hole due to the presence of the other. Only the Doppler boost scenario applied to circular binaries with non-modulated accretion predicts a sinusoidal light curve, while in the general case, binary signals are expected to show more complex periodic patterns. Current searches for massive black hole binaries rely on techniques tailored to quasi-sinusoidal light curves, but fail to identify the more complex periodicities predicted. We present an alternative method that leverages Gaussian processes, making use of a generic periodic kernel flexible enough for the identification of arbitrary periodicities in unevenly sampled light curves with realistic quasar noise. We demonstrate that it outperforms previously proposed strategies in identifying general periodicities by analysing mock light curves with different baselines. Specifically, we find that our analysis can detect non-sinusoidal periodicities (e.g., sawtooth-shaped) and retrieves a higher fraction of true periodicities when compared to periodogram analysis or Gaussian processes analysis with less flexible periodic kernels. Furthermore, by comparing the retrieved fraction of periodicities between mock PTF light curves and mock LSST light curves, we find that our analysis is most sensitive to the number of observed cycles. The application of this analysis has the potential to greatly increase the scientific return of current and upcoming large time-domain photometric surveys."}

From all possible paired property combinations, I found that $σ$$_{\\rm V_{LOS}}$ and $σ$$_{\\rm V_{Tan}}$ resulted to be highly correlated, nearly to the identity relationship. This observation-based correlation resulted to be in an overall very good agreement with that arising from the aforementioned predictions. Additionally, when the four analyzed properties are linked to the accretion groups of the Milky way to which the globular clusters are meant to be associated, I found kinematically cold and hot tidal tails pertaining to globular clusters distributed in all the considered accretion groups. This outcome could be an evidence that globular clusters form in galaxies within a wide variety of dark matter halos, with different masses and profiles."}

We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity.

We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall~9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall~9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions.
