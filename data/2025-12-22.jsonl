This method provided self-consistent measurements of both $M_{BH}$ and $L_{AD}$. The uncertainties on $M_{BH}$ and $L_{AD}$, obtained within the AD-modelling framework ($σ^{AD}_{M_{BH}}\\sim$0.2 dex; $σ^{AD}_{L_{AD}}\\sim$0.1 dex), are significantly smaller than the systematic uncertainties associated with single-epoch $M_{BH}$ ($\\sim$0.4 dex) and $L_{AD}$ derived via bolometric corrections ($\\sim$0.2 dex).

We develop a framework to quantify the detectability of massive neutrinos for different triangle configurations and shapes, and apply it to a case compatible with a Stage-IV spectroscopic survey. We also compare our results with the analysis of simulations without neutrinos, but with different $σ_8$ values, to test whether the 3PCF can break the well-known degeneracy between the two parameters. We find that, as a result of free-streaming, the largest signal is found for quasi-isosceles and squeezed triangles; this signal is increasing for decreasing redshifts. Among these configurations, elongated triangles, tracing the filamentary structure of the cosmic web, are the most affected by the impact of massive neutrinos, with a 3PCF signal increasing with $M_ν$. A complementary source of signal comes from right-angled triangles in $Q$. Importantly, we find that the signatures of a $σ_8$ variation appear significantly different on elongated triangles in $ζ$ and right-angled triangles in $Q$, suggesting that the 3PCF can be used to effectively break the $M_ν- σ_8$ degeneracy. These results open the possibility to use the 3PCF as a powerful complementary tool to constrain neutrino masses in current and future spectroscopic surveys like DESI, Euclid, 4MOST, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope."}

A high observed mass can be explained by the combination of cosmological redshift and gravitational magnification if the source is aligned with a gravitational lens, such as a galaxy. Small-scale objects such as stars and remnants diffract the signal, distorting the wavefront and providing additional lensing signatures. Here we present an analysis of GW231123 combining for the first time the effects of diffraction by a small-scale lens and gravitational magnification by an external potential, modelled as an embedded point-mass lens (PL), finding an intriguing case for the lensing hypothesis. Lensing is favoured by the data, with a false alarm probability of the observed Bayes factors bounded below $<1\\%$, or $\\sim 2.6 σ$ confidence level. Including lensing lowers the total source mass of GW231123 to $100-180 M_\\odot$, closer to BBHs reported so far, and also removes discrepancies between different waveform approximants and the need for high component spins. We reconstruct all source and lens properties, including the microlens mass $190-850 M_\\odot$, its offset, the magnitude of the external gravitational potential and its orientation. The embedded PL analysis leads to a lighter microlens compared to the isolated PL. Within our assumptions, the reconstruction is complete up to an ambiguity between the distance and projected density (mass-sheet degeneracy). Assuming a single galaxy as the macroscopic lens allows us to infer the total amplification of the signal, placing the event at redshift $0.7-2$, and predict the probability $~55\\%$ of forming an additional detectable image due to strong lensing by the macrolens. We discuss the implications of our findings on the source and nature of the microlens, including a possible dark matter origin."}

This phenomenon can occur even when the extra degrees of freedom consist of a triplet of massive Abelian vector fields, as in Multi-Proca dark energy models. In this work, we study gravitational wave oscillations in this class of models minimally coupled to gravity with a general potential, allowing also for a kinetic coupling between the vector field and dark matter that can, in principle, enhance the modulation of gravitational wave amplitudes. After consistently solving the background dynamics, requiring the model parameters to reproduce a phase of late-time accelerated expansion, we assess the accuracy of commonly used analytical approximations and quantify the impact of gravitational wave amplitude modulation for current detectors (LIGO--Virgo) and future missions such as LISA. Although oscillations are present in these scenarios, we find that the effective mass scale (the mixing mass) governing the phenomenon is $m_g \\sim μ_A$, where $μ_A$ is the (time-dependent) effective mass of the vector dark-energy field.

SITELLE fully maps the filaments, offering the first complete views of their kinematics and excitation. Combined with archival ALMA, MUSE and Chandra data, these observations offer a multi-phase view of gas dynamics. The filaments display complex motions inconsistent with simple rotation. Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the warm and cold gas in the central and SE filaments show consistent steep slopes (2/3) and flattening on small scales of a few hundred parsecs, possibly suggesting energy injection from Type Ia supernovae, though interpretation is method-limited. The FE filament shows a lower VSF amplitude, suggesting less active driving. ALMA CO emission is co-spatial and kinematically aligned with the ionized gas, the latter showing broader velocity dispersions. Ionization diagnostics indicate AGN-related processes (e.g., shocks) dominate, with higher-energy excitation near the radio lobes and lower-energy fossil feedback signatures in the FE filament. Finally, the filaments follow the same strong H$α$-X-ray surface brightness correlation seen in other clusters, supporting local thermal coupling between phases.

We examine the distribution of stellar populations in NGC 2276 using multiwavelength data to assess potential evidence of tidal interactions and ram-pressure stripping. We present the first HST WFC3/UVIS images of NGC 2276, and use them to investigate the distribution of stellar populations across the disk of NGC 2276, where we assume that the bluer broadband filters mainly trace younger stellar populations, while the redder filters trace mainly older stellar populations. Furthermore, by comparing HST images with maps of H$α$ emission from Calar Alto's PMAS/PPAK integral field unit (IFU) and near-IR maps from Spitzer's IRAC, we identify arm-like overdensity features that trace the spiral structure of this galaxy and tracked the variation of their pitch angle with radius. Our results indicate that the distribution of the stellar populations is asymmetrical. The youngest stellar populations (up to $\\sim$100 Myr) show higher concentration on the leading side of the galaxy and are more diffuse on the trailing side, consistent with gas compression due to ram-pressure. This asymmetry is visible in the red filters as well. We also show that the average pitch angles of the overdensity features increase with galactocentric distance.

Using an empirical model implemented in SDSS-like mocks, we link the stellar surface-mass-density ($Σ_\\ast$) of a galaxy to $λ_{\\rm a}$ of its host halo and find an anti-correlation that more diffuse dwarfs tend to reside in higher-spin halos. The model naturally reproduces the observed strong clustering of UDGs within the standard $Λ$CDM framework without invoking exotic assumptions such as self-interacting dark matter. The high fraction of unbound particles in UDG hosts likely originates from tidal fields in dense regions, an effect particularly significant for low-mass halos. We discuss how the angular momentum of a halo represented by $λ_{\\rm a}$ may be transferred to the gas to affect size and surface density of the galaxy that forms in the halo."}

Dynamo action determines their dynamical structure and strength. Simulations of combined large- and small-scale dynamos have successfully developed mean fields with strength and topology consistent with observations but with turbulent fields much weaker than observed, while simulations of small-scale dynamos with parameters relevant to the interstellar medium yield turbulent fields an order of magnitude below the values observed or expected theoretically. We use the Pencil Code accelerated on GPUs with Astaroth to perform high-resolution simulations of a supernova-driven galactic dynamo including heating and cooling in a periodic domain. Our models show that the strength of the turbulent field produced by the small-scale dynamo approaches an asymptote at only modest magnetic Prandtl numbers. This allows us to use these models to suggest the essential characteristics of this constituent of the magnetic field for inclusion in global galactic models. The asymptotic limit occurs already at magnetic Prandtl number of only a few hundred, many orders of magnitude below physical values in the the interstellar medium and consistent with previous findings for isothermal compressible flows."}
