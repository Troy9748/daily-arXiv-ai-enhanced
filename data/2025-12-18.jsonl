ULDM is based on exceptionally light particles and yields galactic halos with dense central solitons. This increases the drag experienced by binary SMBH, decreasing merger times and potentially suppressing gravitational radiation from the binary at low frequencies. We develop semi-analytic models for the decay of SMBH binaries in ULDM halos and use current pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements to constrain the ULDM particle mass and its fractional contribution to the dark matter content of the universe. We find a median ULDM particle mass of $7. \\times 10^{-22}$ eV and show that scaling relations suggest that the drag remains effective at relatively low ULDM fractions, which are consistent with all other constraints on the model. Consequently, future pulsar timing measurements will be a sensitive probe of any ULDM contribution to the overall dark matter content of the universe."}

However, some recent JWST studies have shown the existence of a population of dwarf galaxies with an unexpectedly large dust attenuation. Using the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) data, we identified a sample of 1361 highly extincted low-mass (HELM) galaxies, defined as dwarf galaxies ($M_*<10^{8.5}$) with Av>1mag or more massive galaxies with an exceptionally high dust attenuation given their stellar mass (i.e., $Av>1.6log_{10}(M_*/Mo)-12.6$). The selection is performed using the multiparameter distribution obtained through a comprehensive spectral energy distribution fitting analysis, based on optical to near-infrared data. After excluding possible contaminants, like brown dwarfs, little red dots, high-z (z>8.5) and ultra-high-z (z>15) galaxies, the sample mainly includes sources at z<1, with a tail extending up to z=7.2. The sample has a median stellar mass of $10^7$ Mo and a median dust attenuation of Av=2mag. We analysed the morphology, environment and star-formation rate of these sources to investigate the reason of their large dust attenuation. In particular, HELM sources have sizes (effective radii, Re) similar to non-dusty dwarf galaxies and no correlation is visible between the axis ratios (b/a) and the dust attenuation. This findings indicate that it is unlikely that the large dust attenuation is due to projection effects, but a prolate or a disk-on oblate geometry are still possible, at least for a subsample of the sources. We have found that the distribution of HELM sources is slightly skewed toward more clustered environments than non-dusty dwarfs and tend to be slightly less star forming. This finding, if confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up, indicates that HELM sources could be going through some environmental processes, such as galaxy interactions."}

They are likely massive, heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that substantially contribute to the cosmic SFR density at z > 3. To identify drivers of their high dust attenuation and their role in early universe galaxy evolution, we analyse the stellar morphology of 65 OFGs (from 1892 SFGs at 3<z<4) using NIRCAM/F444W imaging from the PRIMER and CEERS fields. We study correlations between dust attenuation ($A_{v}$) and galaxy properties, like stellar mass, size, and orientation, and compare scaling relations between OFGs and typical SFGs. We find that OFGs are ~8-9 times more massive and ~4 times more dust attenuated than the parent sample. Structurally, OFGs resemble parent SFGs in median $R_e$ and median $Σ_{R_e}$ but may be slightly rounder on average. While $A_v$ strongly correlates with stellar mass, it does not show significant dependence on stellar mass-normalised effective radius and stellar mass surface density, Sérsic index, axis ratio, or SFR surface density. The mass-size and mass-surface density relations place OFGs as a higher-mass extension of SFGs, with no concrete proof of evolutionary differences between them. This suggests that OFGs are heavily dust-obscured primarily due to their high stellar masses, which facilitates dust production and retention, with older stellar populations likely contributing as well. Although some OFGs exhibit high $Σ_\\mathrm{R_e}$ and occupy regions of the mass-size plane similar to quiescent galaxies, the overall sample is not representative of this. Their current structures resemble typical SFGs, with no concrete signs of rapid compaction. Diversity in their physical properties shows that OFGs span a range of evolutionary states with few showing reduced star formation, while most remain actively star-forming."}

In this work, we investigate two distinct physical scenarios for the origin of bulk viscosity: (1) nonminimal interactions between two fluids, and (2) elastic collisions in an ideal gas. In both cases, we demonstrate that while the associated energy-momentum exchange can significantly influence fluid dynamics, overall energy-momentum conservation precludes such exchange from having any direct gravitational effect in the context of General Relativity. In case (1), we show that the standard bulk viscous energy-momentum tensor can be obtained for the two-fluid system only at the cost of the violation of all classical energy conditions: null, weak, dominant, and strong. In case (2), we consider a single fluid composed of point particles undergoing instantaneous, energy- and momentum-conserving collisions, and find that the proper pressure remains strictly non-negative, with the equation-of-state parameter confined to the interval $[0,1/3]$. In both scenarios, achieving a sufficiently negative effective pressure to drive cosmic acceleration requires assumptions that compromise the physical viability of the model. Our results highlight some of the key physical challenges involved in modeling dark energy through bulk viscous effects."}

We consider three different approaches which aim to `null' the high-$k$ modes using transformations applied to the data vector: the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform which operates on the lensing field, a new implementation of an LU factorisation of the discretized Limber integral (LUnul) which operates on the lensing two-point statistics, and finally a method which uses a correlated LSS tracers to suppress contributions from lower redshifts (cross-correlation). We compare these methods to un-nulled (or standard) cosmic shear at the data vector level and assess whether these methods are able to reduce the bias on cosmological constraints using a Fisher forecast. We find that the nulling techniques considered can have a large impact on reducing the bias on $S_8$ and Dark Energy parameters. The cross-correlation method is effective at reducing biases in $S_8$, but requires additional information from galaxy clustering. The LUnul method is the most aggressive of the methods and hence reduces biases most efficiently as $k_{\\rm max}$ is increased, although this improvement in accuracy comes at the cost of precision. The BNT approach preserves more information than LUnul, and has a more rigorous theoretical grounding. We demonstrate that all three of these methods are effective at mitigating bias, and can be readily applied in forthcoming lensing analyses."}

Shapiro DG-III (Sha DG-III) is an isolated dwarf on the edge of the ultra-faint regime.

Considering their quenched stellar populations, indicated by the lack of coincident GALEX emission, relative distances, and fitting models, the galaxies are consistent with a backsplash origin and are pending follow-up. Analysis is performed to test whether the system's population can be explained by standard cosmology. A potential correlation is found between satellite abundances and halo masses calibrated by tidal indices in a sample of nearby MW-like galaxies, suggesting the importance of environmental density in the formation of dark matter subhaloes, though a larger sample is required.

However, one of the major outstanding questions in astrophysics will remain: understanding how galaxies acquire and evolve their angular momentum and how this connects to the cosmic web. Measuring the alignments between galaxy spins and cosmic filaments across cosmic time, and understanding what this reveals about galaxy evolution, requires surveys that also characterise intrinsic alignments, i.e. correlations in galaxy shapes produced by the cosmic web itself rather than by lensing. Intrinsic alignments are a major source of systematic error in weak-lensing measurements of the fundamental parameters of the Universe. Addressing both questions together will necessitate new types of MOS surveys that combine kinematic information with high-completeness redshifts down to at least 24-25mag. To achieve our science goals, we require a new generation of wide-field spectroscopic facilities that can obtain spin-filament alignment measurements for millions of galaxies while simultaneously delivering sub-Mpc resolution of the cosmic web and spatially-resolved kinematics required to map the spin-filament connection at the level of individual galaxies within their local cosmic environment. Such a program would provide a unique legacy survey of galaxies and cosmic structures from kiloparsec to megaparsec scales, establishing ESO's leadership in bridging the physics of galaxy evolution with the systematic-control requirements for Stage-IV cosmological surveys."}

We determine what can drive an $α$-bimodality of the disc in a zoom-in hydrodynamical simulated galaxy which has had no major mergers and negligible radial migration. Using a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 suite of simulations, we analyse gas flows in the disc together with its star formation and merger history, as well as the chemical evolution of the hot corona, to investigate their connection to transitions in the chemo-dynamical structure of the stellar disc and its radial distribution. The simulated galaxy exhibits high and low-$α$ sequences without having experienced major mergers nor significant radial migration. A high-$α$ thick disc forms during the early chaotic clustering phase. Afterwards, as the star formation rate declines, a dip in the stellar number density appears, coinciding with the dilution of the galactic corona by a minor merger, which subsequently halts the rise of [Fe/H] in the disc. Later, accreted gas onto the disc from minor mergers, mildly enhances the star formation rate and generates the low-$α$ sequence in the outer disc, with radial inward flows of this material feeding the low-$α$ inner disc. Furthermore, we find that even at fixed radii, newly formed stars retain a sizable spread in their chemical abundances, reflecting chemical differences between the in-situ and the infalling gas from which they formed, further indicating that instantaneous gas mixing is invalid. Understanding the chemical evolution of stellar discs requires accounting for their accretion merger history and interaction with the surrounding hot corona, as well as the vertical and radial gas flows that redistribute metals within the disc."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "The recent discovery of a large population of overmassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe challenges the validity of the BH-host galaxy coevolution framework. However, the reliability of the estimated BH masses (M$_{BH}$) is being questioned, as these are typically derived using single-epoch (SE) relations calibrated locally. Calibrating SE relations at high redshift would therefore enable more accurate M$_{BH}$ estimates and help identify potential biases. In this work, we release a data-reduction technique for JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations that doubles the effective wavelength coverage, enabling detection of otherwise inaccessible emission. Whenever adjacent dispersers are required, observers should carefully evaluate the tradeoff between integrating longer in the bluer configuration alone versus distributing the exposure time across two dispersers. We apply this pipeline to a sample of 5 quasars at z~2 with M$_{BH}$ independently measured through reverberation mapping (RM). This enables a joint analysis of both H$β$ and H$α$; the latter lying beyond the nominal wavelength range. We assess the reliability of the most widely adopted SE calibrations, finding that H$β$ yields the closest agreement with RM-based M$_{BH}$ estimates, whereas H$α$-based estimators exhibit a larger scatter. For the least massive BH in our sample ($M_{BH,RM}$~$10^{7.5}M_\\odot$), which is accreting at a rate close to the Eddington limit ($λ_{Edd}=0.8$), all SE calibrators overestimate M$_{\\rm BH, RM}$ by one order of magnitude. This may indicate a systematic overestimation of M$_{BH}$ for highly accreting BHs at high redshift. Finally, we provide the first high-redshift SE calibration based on H$α$ and H$β$. Although a larger sample is needed to reduce the uncertainties, our calibration can already be applied to the newly discovered BH population in the early Universe."}

Their formation is typically attributed to a head-on collision of a massive galaxy with a compact satellite (intruder), triggering density waves that, propagating outward, produce the characteristic ring morphology. Here, we present the discovery and detailed analysis of GS18660, the most distant ring galaxy known to date, at z=3.08, identified in JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations as part of the GA-NIFS programme. This work aims to characterise the physical and dynamical properties of GS18660 and shed light into the formation of its ring. Specifically, we analyse the ionized gas properties, stellar populations, and gas kinematics of the system, and use the observed geometry to constrain the timescale of the collision. Our analysis is based on NIRSpec IFS data, including low-resolution (R~100) spectroscopy covering ~0.2-1.3um rest-frame, and high-resolution (R~2700) spectroscopy covering 0.4-0.8um rest-frame. Multi-wavelength techniques are applied to derive nebular gas conditions and stellar population properties. Gas kinematic analysis reveals that GS18660 exhibits a rotating disk component with an additional radial expansion velocity of ~200 km/s, consistent with a propagating collisional wave. Nebular line diagnostics indicate intense star formation (SFR ~100 Msun/yr) along the ring and in the nucleus. Stellar population analysis shows that the most recent star formation episode, occurring within the last ~50 Myr, predominantly took place in the ring. We also identify a close companion, the intruder galaxy responsible for the collision, moving away with a relative velocity of ~425 km/s. The evidence strongly favours a collisional origin for the ring in GS18660, though the presence of a recently formed bar (and hence a resonance ring) cannot be completely excluded."}

As this gas is channelled towards the galaxy centre, the most extreme values in the analysed properties are found for the circumnuclear HII regions. Unlike the bar strength, galaxy mass does seem to affect the properties of the HII regions, with massive galaxies presenting higher values in most of the properties, possibly due to the increased amount of gas in these systems. This study provides evidence that the bar-driven redistribution of material within the galaxy inner parts causes significant differences in the HII region properties depending on their location within the galaxies."}

Effelsberg's continuum view and data release", "comment": "19 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Extended radio continuum emission and its linear polarization play a key role in probing large-scale structures of synchrotron and free-free emission in the Milky Way. Despite the existence of many radio continuum surveys, sensitive and high-angular-resolution single-dish surveys of extended radio continuum emission remain scarce. As part of the GLObal view of STAR formation (GLOSTAR) survey, we will also crucially complement the existing data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) by addressing the missing zero-spacing gap. Within the framework of the GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey, we performed large-scale radio continuum imaging observations toward the Galactic plane in the range $-2^{\\circ}< \\ell <60^{\\circ}$ and $|b|<1.1^{\\circ}$, as well as the Cygnus X region with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. We present the Effelsberg continuum survey at 4.89GHz and 6.82GHz including linear polarization with angular resolutions of 145$^{\\prime\\prime}$ and 106$^{\\prime\\prime}$, respectively. The survey has been corrected for missing large-scale emission using available low-angular-resolution surveys. Comparison with previous single-dish surveys indicates that our continuum survey represents the highest-quality single-dish data collected to date at this frequency. More than 90\\% of the flux density missed by the VLA D-array data is effectively recovered by the Effelsberg continuum survey. The improved sensitivity and angular resolution of our survey enable reliable mapping of Galactic magnetic field structures, with polarization data that are less affected by depolarization than in previous surveys. The GLOSTAR single-dish continuum data will be released publicly, offering a valuable resource for studying extended objects including HII regions, supernova remnants, diffuse interstellar medium, and Galactic structure.

Generalization Efficiency of Unsupervised Strategies and Supervised Learning in Galaxy Morphological Classification", "comment": null, "summary": "We conduct a systematic robustness analysis of the hybrid machine learning framework \\texttt{USmorph}, which integrates unsupervised and supervised learning for galaxy morphological classification. Although \\texttt{USmorph} has already been applied to nearly 100,000 $I$-band galaxy images in the COSMOS field ($0.2 < z < 1.2$, $I_{\\mathrm{mag}} < 25$), the stability of its core modules has not been quantitatively assessed. Our tests show that the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) achieves the best performance in preserving structural information when adopting an intermediate network depth, $5\\times5$ convolutional kernels, and a 40-dimensional latent representation. The adaptive polar coordinate transform (APCT) effectively enhances rotational invariance and improves the robustness of downstream tasks. In the unsupervised stage, a bagging clustering number of $K=50$ provides the optimal trade-off between classification granularity and labeling efficiency. For supervised learning, we employ GoogLeNet, which exhibits stable performance without overfitting. We validate the reliability of the final classifications through two independent tests: (1) the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization reveals clear clustering boundaries in the low-dimensional space; and (2) the morphological classifications are consistent with theoretical expectations of galaxy evolution, with both true and false positives showing unbiased distributions in the parameter space. These results demonstrate the strong robustness of the \\texttt{USmorph} algorithm, providing guidance for its future application to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) mission."}

This dual-stage design enables efficient knowledge transfer from large-scale visual datasets while preserving morphological pattern geometry through UMAP's neighborhood preservation. We apply the upgraded UML on I-band images of 99,806 COSMOS galaxies at redshift $0.2<z<1.2$ (to ensure rest-frame optical morphology) with $I_{\\mathrm{mag}}<25$. The predefined cluster number is optimized to 20 (reduced from 50 in the original framework), achieving significant computational savings. The 20 algorithmically identified clusters are merged into five physical morphology types. About 51\\% of galaxies (50,056) were successfully classified. To assess classification effectiveness, we tested morphological parameters for massive galaxies with $M_{*}>10^{9}~M_{\\odot}$. Our classification results align well with galaxy evolution theory. This improved algorithm significantly enhances galaxy morphology classification efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale sky surveys such as those planned with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST)."}
