Usually, these secular processes are studied in N-body and hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way analogues with stellar-dominated discs. In contrast, discs at high redshift are gas-rich, which may qualitatively change how secular evolution proceeds. We use the Nexus framework to construct and evolve a suite of isolated galaxies with fixed halo and disc mass but varying initial disc gas fraction, from 0% to 100%. We show that in gas-rich models, the root-mean-square change in stellar angular momentum is up to a factor of two larger than in gas-poor analogues and is accompanied by stronger radial and vertical heating, leading to enhanced radial mixing. We further dissect the role of gas in specific migration channels. For bar-driven migration, corotation resonance dragging dominates in gas-poor discs, whereas in gas-rich discs, stars more readily reach and accumulate at the outer Lindblad resonance, which acts as a barrier. The high radial mixing efficiency in gas-rich phases can flatten the stellar metallicity gradient relative to that of the initial gaseous disc within only a few orbital timescales. Together, these results imply that radial mixing in early, gas-rich discs is substantially more vigorous than in late-time, gas-poor discs, naturally producing distinct evolutionary tracks for chemically bimodal discs such as that of the Milky Way."}

Understanding the physical properties and star formation histories (SFH) of high redshift systems is key to distinguish between the different proposed scenarios. We identify and analyse a sample of 2420 robust candidates at z~7-14 drawn from the ASTRODEEP-JWST dataset over ~0.2 deg^2 and model their properties with non-parametric SFHs to derive their specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar population properties. We find that the median sSFR and M/L remain roughly constant across the probed redshift range. We show that this result is robust against potential systematics unless a hidden population of dust-enshrouded starbursts, undetectable in current data, exists at these redshifts. In any case, the absence of observed high-sSFR systems at the highest redshifts suggests that any dust-free starburst phase must be short-lived. The observed sSFR evolution is in tension with most (though not all) theoretical models, making it a key quantity for discriminating among competing scenarios. The sample shows a wide range of physical conditions and galaxy classes, including systems with low sSFR and high mass-to-light ratios (M/L) up to z~10, indicative of already evolved galaxies only a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang, and different degrees of dust attenuation. We finally attempt to reconstruct the assembly histories of two sub-samples: a) the highest-M/L galaxies at z~7-8, which appear to have formed the bulk of their stars at least 500 Myr before observation, implying progenitors observable as UV-bright sources at z>20, and b) z>11 galaxies, which formed through stochastic SFH, remaining UV-faint for most of their early evolution, before undergoing recent (~50 Myr old) episodes of major growth."}

The distribution and kinematics of the HI, including multiple gaseous bridges, indicate the group is a gravitationally bound system. The HI maps further reveal two newly discovered dwarf satellites easily identified by their gas but only barely visible in optical images. The four dwarf group members previously identified in SDSS have 9.06 < log(Mstar/Msun) < 9.43 and 9.42 < log(MHI/Msun) < 9.73. The two newly discovered dwarf satellites have log(Mstar/Msun) = 6.10 with log(MHI/Msun) = 8.71 and log(Mstar/Msun) = 7.07 with log(MHI/Msun) = 9.18. New Gemini optical spectra link the HI detections and their optical counterparts. The group's 3D velocity dispersion (188 km/s), mass-to-light ratio (M_L/B ~44), dynamical-to-baryonic mass ratio (Mdyn/Mbary ~ 21), size (69 kpc), and gas fraction (0.56) are all consistent with the compact dwarf groups in the TNG50 simulation. The group has a top-heavy satellite mass function that is inconsistent with predictions for LMC-sized hosts and may instead be two or more groups coming together. A Voronoi tessellation reveals the group resides in a tendril outside the intersection of two filaments. These intermediate density environments within large scale structure provide the conditions needed for groups of star forming, gas-rich dwarf galaxies to form and eventually merge. Our results further show that it is possible to uncover fainter dwarf satellites around dwarf galaxy hosts via HI maps."}

Cluster candidates were first detected as overdense regions in redshift space through the Finger-of-God (FoG) effect, and cluster membership was assigned using the GalWeight technique within the FoG-GalWeight methodology developed by our team. For each cluster, we derived the virial radius (R200), velocity dispersion (sigma200), and virial mass (M200) using the virial mass estimator. We identified ten VIPERS clusters spanning a mass range of 0.59 x 10^14 <= M200/(h^-1 Msun) <= 4.32 x 10^14 and velocity dispersions of 360 <= sigma200 <= 900 km s^-1. We cross-matched the VIPERS clusters with published catalogs and found at least one matching system for each cluster, offering external validation for our detections. We investigated the velocity dispersion-mass relation for these systems and obtained log(sigma200) = (2.73 +/- 0.06) + (0.36 +/- 0.18) log(M200), with an intrinsic scatter of sigma_int = 0.04 +/- 0.07. The derived relation is consistent with theoretical predictions from N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, confirming the reliability of the FoG-GalWeight methodology and the robustness of the virial mass estimator. Our findings demonstrate that the velocity dispersion can serve as a reliable and direct proxy for cluster mass, even at high redshift, without requiring additional dynamical mass modeling."}

Insights into the Merger Scenario", "comment": "submitted to A&A", "summary": "AC114 is a historically significant galaxy cluster, being one of the first strong lensing clusters detected from the ground in the early 1990s, prior to the launch of the HST. Despite this early prominence, no detailed lensing analyses have been carried out for more than fifteen years. We here study this cluster using JWST imaging obtained as part of the SLICE program, complemented by archival HST and X-ray observations. JWST data reveal ten new multiply imaged systems and enable the identification of conjugate substructures in several of the sixteen systems, significantly increasing the number of strong lensing constraints. Using these data, we construct a parametric mass model with Lenstool and extend it by explicitly incorporating the Chandra data in a combined strong lensing+X-ray fit. Our best-fit model reproduces the multiple images with an RMS of 0.4\" while simultaneously matching the X-ray data. The dark matter distribution is unimodal and centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, with a large core radius of 83+-5kpc, consistent with values reported in other strong lensing clusters. The strong lensing constraints require the inclusion of an external shear component which position angle points unambiguously towards a nearby (~1Mpc), well defined mass concentration at the same redshift in the North-West, for which we propose the naming AC114b. The spatial coverage of the XMM-Newton data encompasses the whole structure, allowing us to probe the X-ray properties of the companion cluster and the thermodynamics of AC114, providing evidence for a major merger, in line with previous signatures seen in Chandra, radio and optical spectroscopic data. Our results shed new light on the merging scenario, revealing a major merger caught in a late post-collisional phase, where AC114 is the dominant system and Ac114b has likely been stripped of its hot gas."}

NGC 1266 is an excellent case study for investigating the outflows and star formation quenching because it is a nearby (D\\sim30 Mpc) AGN host galaxy with an outflow driving shocks through the interstellar medium (ISM) and has recently quenched its star formation outside the nucleus. While previous works have studied the molecular outflow from its CO emission, to fully characterize the impact the outflow has on the ISM observations probing the dense, cold gas are necessary. Our ALMA cycle 0 observations do not detect a molecular outflow in 13CO(2-1) and yield a lower limit 12CO/13CO \\geq 250, suggesting a highly optically thin CO outflow with low 13CO abundance. In contrast, we detect substantial HCN(1-0) emission in the outflow, with an HCN(1-0)/12CO(1-0) ratio of 0.09, consistent with global measurements of many star-forming galaxies and Luminous InfraRed Galaxies (LIRGs). We conclude that the CO emission traces a diffuse component of the molecular gas with a low optical depth, whereas the HCN(1-0) traces dense clumps of gas entrained in the outflow. We measure an upper limit molecular outflow rate of < 85 Msun/yr. Assuming the ongoing nuclear star formation and outflow continue at the same rates, NGC 1266 will deplete its gas reservoirs in 450 Myr or longer, indicating that relatively low-level AGN feedback is capable of gradually expelling the molecular gas reservoir after a rapid quenching event."}

Thus, Euclid has the potential to test deviations from general relativity that will allow us to shed light on long-lasting problems in the standard cosmological model, $Λ$CDM. Euclid will mainly do this by using two complementary probes: weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. In this paper we review pre-launch Euclid analyses for dark energy and modified gravity. These include forecast constraints with future Euclid data on cosmological parameters for different cosmological models, such as a time-varying dark energy component, phenomenological modifications of the perturbation sector and specific modified gravity models, with further extensions that include neutrino physics and the coupling to the electromagnetic sector through the fine-structure constant. We review the study of the impact of nonlinear clustering methods on beyond-$Λ$CDM constraints with Euclid. This is of fundamental importance to efficiently predict the large-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos, given that we will have access to a wealth of information on scales beyond the linear regime. We inspect the extension of theoretical predictions for observable quantities in alternative cosmologies to $Λ$CDM at fully nonlinear scales by means of $N$-body simulations. We discuss the impact of relativistic corrections in extended cosmological models. Overall, this review highlights the significant potential of the Euclid mission to tightly constrain parameters of dark energy and modified gravity models, or perhaps to detect possible signatures of a $Λ$CDM failure."}

Over the years, several techniques have been developed to mitigate the impact of residual biases prior to calibration, including the inference of shear responses on images to correct multiplicative biases, and the empirical correction of additive biases. We introduce a novel methodology that generalises upon the state-of-the-art approaches by inferring multiplicative and additive biases jointly from parameterised distributions of measured ellipticities, crucially without relying on external simulations and independently from cosmology. Shear biases are marginalised over the unknown hyper-parameters in the modelling, hence mitigating the impact of degeneracies. We apply the technique to a representative problem and show the performance of the estimation, even in the presence of noise. The method has a high potential for applicability to the calibration of weak lensing cosmic shear in current and future lensing surveys."}

Evidence for a star formation-driven outflow at z = 8.6", "comment": "22 pages, 13 figures, Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "Understanding the physical conditions and feedback mechanisms in early massive galaxies is essential to uncover how they formed and evolved during the first billion years of the Universe. In this context, the galaxy EGSY8p7/CEERS-1019 at z=8.6 provides an excellent benchmark, given its stellar mass of $10^{9.3}M_\\odot$ and elevated N/O abundance despite its sub-solar metallicity. In this study, we present new JWST/NIRSpec observations offering the first spatially resolved spectroscopy of this galaxy, with higher sensitivity and spectral resolution than previous studies. We identify broad (FWHM=650km/s) H$β$ and [OIII] emission components whose emission is located between the two rest-frame UV clumps of the galaxy and extended over a distance of $\\sim1kpc$. The morphology and kinematics of these components indicate that the broad emission arises from outflowing gas rather than from an AGN broad-line region. The kinetic energy injection rate from stellar feedback is an order of magnitude higher than that of the outflow, while the radiation pressure rate is comparable to the outflow momentum rate. These results suggest that stellar feedback alone can drive the outflow, with radiation pressure potentially providing the required momentum transfer. We derive a low mass-loading factor ($η=0.16$) and ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{esc}=0.021\\pm0.014$). Together with the high electron density measured ($n_e=2200cm^{-3}$), these results support the interpretation that most of the gas remains confined within the galaxy. Comparisons of diagnostic emission-line ratios with photoionization and shock models support a star-formation-driven ionization scenario, ruling out any excitation by AGN radiation. Finally, the absence of detectable Wolf-Rayet features suggests that alternative mechanisms must be considered to explain the high N/O ratio in this galaxy."}

Impact of mass accretion on the thermodynamical structure of the ICM", "comment": "Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 13 pages, 9 figures, 1 table + appendices (4 pages, 4 figures)", "summary": "Context. The internal structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) is tightly linked to the assembly history and physical processes in groups and clusters, but the role of recent accretion in shaping these profiles has not been fully explored.\n  Aims. We investigate to what extent mass accretion accounts for the variability in ICM density and thermodynamic profiles, and what can present-day structures reveal about their formation histories.\n  Methods. We analyze a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation including gas cooling but no feedback, to isolate the effects of heating from structure formation. Median profiles of ICM quantities are introduced as a robust description of the bulk ICM. We then examine correlations between mass accretion rates or assembly indicators with the profiles of temperature, entropy, pressure, gas and dark-matter density, as well as their scatter.\n  Results. Accretion in the last dynamical time strongly lowers central gas densities, while leaving dark matter largely unaffected, producing a distinct signature in the baryon depletion function. Pressure and entropy show the clearest dependence on accretion, whereas temperature is less sensitive. The radii of steepest entropy, temperature, and pressure shift inward by $\\sim (10-20)\\%$ between high- and low-accretion subsamples. Assembly-state indicators are also related to the location of these features, and accretion correlates with the parameters of common fitting functions for density, pressure, and entropy.\n  Conclusions. Recent accretion leaves measurable imprints on the ICM structure, highlighting the potential of thermodynamic profiles as diagnostics of cluster growth history."}

Pre-stellar cores exhibit some of the highest levels of deuteration because their physical conditions greatly favor deuteration processes. Deuteration maps are a measure of the effectiveness of the deuteration across the core, and they are useful to study both the deuteration as well as the formation mechanism of the main species. Methanol is the simplest O-bearing complex organic molecule (COM) detected in the interstellar medium (ISM). It represents the beginning of molecular complexity in star-forming regions, thus a complete understanding of its formation and deuteration is a necessary step to understand the development of further chemical complexity. In this paper, we use single-dish observations with the IRAM 30 m telescope and state-of-the-art chemical models to investigate the deuteration of methanol towards the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. We also compare the results of the chemical models with previous observations of deuterated methanol towards the pre-stellar cores HMM1 and L694-2. The spectra extracted from the CHD$_2$OH map show that the emission is concentrated in the center and towards the north-west of the core. Using deep observations towards the dust and the methanol peaks of the core, we derive a very large deuterium fraction for methanol ($\\sim20\\%$) towards both peaks. The comparison of our observational results with chemical models has highlighted the importance of H-abstraction processes in the formation and deuteration of methanol. Deep observations combined with state-of-the-art chemical models are of fundamental importance in understanding the development of molecular complexity in the ISM. Our analysis also shows the importance of non-LTE effects when measuring the D/H ratios in methanol."}

For our study, we use Galactic Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder H I Survey data and produce H I emission and absorption cubes on 7 pc scales. To examine the CNM structures toward 30 Dor, we decompose the H I absorption cube into 862 Gaussian components and find that these components are distributed at four velocity ranges (B1, B2, B3, and B4, respectively): 200$-$230 km s$^{-1}$, 230$-$260 km s$^{-1}$, 260$-$277 km s$^{-1}$, and 277$-$300 km s$^{-1}$. We derive line-of-sight average spin temperatures and opacity-corrected total H I column densities and show that the B1$-$B4 structures have systematically different properties, indicating that they are physically distinct. As for the nature of the observed CNM structures, we find that B2 is associated with the main dense structure where ionized, atomic, and molecular gases are concentrated. B3 and B4 trace inflows whose combined mass flux rate of 0.14 $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is comparable to the current star formation rate, while B1 probes outflows with a much lower mass flux rate of 0.007 $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Interestingly, the H I column densities in B1$-$B4 are nearly uniform with a factor of two spatial variations, implying the presence of H I shielding layers for H$_{2}$ formation."}

E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\\approx 2πG$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\\approx 2π\\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e> G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era."}

Critically, the lack of X-ray Integral Field Units currently limits our ability to acquire spatially resolved velocity information in the X-ray regime. However, instead, this can be achieved using the James Webb Space Telescope. As part of an ongoing investigation of the nuclear feedback processes in the nearby luminous AGN NGC 7469, we present an analysis of the kinematics of the X-ray emitting outflows using near-infrared footprint lines such as [Mg VIII] 3.03 um. These high-ionization emission lines are associated with the same gas analyzed in the X-ray, and thus can be used to probe the footprint of the X-ray wind's velocity structure and ionization state. Thanks to the wide wavelength range available with JWST we also use nebular (e.g. [S IV] 10.51 um) and coronal (e.g. [Ne V] 14.32 um) emission lines to offer a comprehensive multi-phase view of the outflows. We present mass and kinetic energy outflow rates, and find that while the feedback processes in NGC 7469 are not efficient by theoretical benchmarks, the most massive and energetic component is the high ionization X-ray gas."}

Starting from lightcone-based HEALPix maps and catalogues, we present a new set of mock CMB maps constructed in a self-consistent manner from the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, including CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, cosmic infrared background, radio point source and anisotropic screening maps. We show that these simulations reproduce a wide range of observational constraints. We also compare our simulations with previous predictions based on dark matter-only simulations which generally model the secondary anisotropies independently from one another, concluding that our hydrodynamical simulation mocks perform at least as well as previous mocks in matching the observations whilst retaining self-consistency in the predictions of the different components. Using the model variations in FLAMINGO, we further explore how the signals depend on cosmology and feedback modelling, and we predict cross-correlations between some of the signals that differ significantly from those in previous mocks. The mock CMB maps should provide a valuable resource for exploring correlations between different secondary anisotropies and other large-scale structure tracers, and can be applied to forecasts for upcoming surveys."}

We investigate the role of filaments in high-mass star formation, whether gas flows from large to small scales along them, and what their properties might reveal about the region they are found in. Methods. The Max Planck IRAM Observatory Program (MIOP), the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE), includes high spatial resolution (~3'') data of HCO+(1-0) and H13CO+(1-0) emission in the star-forming DR20 region in the Cygnus X complex. In this data we identify filaments with the structure identification algorithm DisPerSE. We further analyze these filaments using Gaussian fits to the spectra to determine the line peak velocity and full width half maximum along them. The Python package FilChaP was used to determine filament widths. Results. We find projected velocity gradients inside several filaments between 0.4 to 2.4km/s over projected length-scales of 0.1pc toward star-forming cores. This can be interpreted as a sign of gas flowing along the filaments toward the cores. The filament width distributions exhibit median values between 0.06 and 0.14pc depending on the core, the tracer, and the method. Standard deviations are approximately 0.02 to 0.06pc. These values are roughly in agreement with the filament width of 0.1pc typically found in nearby low-mass star-forming regions. Conclusions. This first analysis of filamentary properties within the Cygnus X CASCADE program reveals potential signatures of gas flows along filaments onto star-forming cores. Furthermore, the characteristics of the filaments in this high-mass star-forming region can be compared to those of filaments in low-mass star-forming regions typically studied before. Extending such studies to the entire CASCADE survey will enhance our knowledge of high-mass filament properties on solid statistical grounds."}
