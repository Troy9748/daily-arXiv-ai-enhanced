In this work, we use an optimized version of the principal component analysis (PCA) to model uncertainties in the full shape of the redshift distributions, a method proposed by \\cite{pca_method} and recently used in the Dark Energy Survey Y6 analysis. Here, we implement this new approach within the Roman High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team (PIT) pipeline, namely Cobaya-Cosmolike Joint Architecture (\\texttt{CoCoA}). To validate the PCA in mitigating biases on cosmological parameters, $S_8$ and $Ω_m$, we use a set of redshift distributions from \\texttt{Cardinal} generated for a variety of Roman configurations. Overall, when the simulated cosmic shear data vector is not strongly miscalibrated relative to the fiducial one, both the mean-shift and the PCA-based approaches produce consistent cosmological constraints when marginalizing over nuisance parameters. For mild to strong miscalibration, including additional PCs progressively mitigates biases in $S_8$ and $Ω_m$, and can achieve comparable performance with fewer parameters than the nine tomographic-bin mean-shift model."}

The analysis incorporates data from the 2019/20 seasons of the SPT-3G survey in bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz; from the full SPTpol dataset at 150 GHz; and from {\\it Herschel}-SPIRE survey in bands centered at 600 and 857 GHz. We combine data from all the above bands using linear combination (LC) techniques to produce a tSZ or Compton-$y$ map. We modify the LC weights to produce multiple versions of the Compton-$y$ map, including minimum-variance (MV) and foreground-minimized (-min) maps. We measure the auto- and cross-spectra of a subset of these maps in the range $\\ell \\in [500, 5000]$. While this power spectrum includes contributions from signals other than tSZ, we present numerous checks to show that the most challenging foreground signal, the cosmic infrared background (CIB) is much lower than the desired tSZ signal in the scales of interest in this work. The final tSZ power spectrum is measured at $9.3σ$ with both the MV and CIB-min maps. Our results are consistent with those reported in other CMB surveys across the literature. Using the difference in the tSZ power spectrum from MV and CIB-min maps, we reconstruct the scale-dependent tSZ-CIB cross-correlation $ρ_{\\ell}^{\\rm tSZ \\times CIB}$, finding $3.1σ$ evidence for a nonzero correlation coefficient that is positive on large scales and approaches zero for $\\ell > 2500$. This result represents the deepest tSZ maps ever produced and provides new constraints that can help refine astrophysical feedback mechanisms and models of the intracluster medium."}

Their enhanced sensitivity to feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) make them excellent laboratories to test whether feedback prescriptions in cosmological simulations accurately reproduce their interstellar medium (ISM) properties.

The detected sample includes a roughly equal mix of early-type and late-type dwarfs, suggesting that it is representative of the broader dwarf galaxy population in low-density environments. We find that the observed MIRI flux distributions are comparable to forward-modelled flux distributions of mass-matched simulated galaxies in TNG50. We further conduct a multi-wavelength morphological analysis complementing the JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging with archival HST/ACS data, employing the CAS (concentration, asymmetry, smoothness) framework. Among the multi-wavelength images, MIRI exhibits the largest variation in CAS parameters, likely due to dust lanes and clumps in several galaxies, also suggested by Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. This suggests that the dust content in these systems may be higher than those implied by rest-frame optical or near-infrared observations alone. Upcoming UV/optical and mid-infrared spectroscopic follow-up will be critical for constraining the gas kinematics and dust grain properties of dwarf galaxies in low-density environments such as COSMOS."}

However, the composition and structure of dust in distant galaxies are still poorly understood. We have started a JWST MIRI MRS program investigating the dust features in gas-rich and dusty galaxies at redshifts $z<$1.2, with strong 2175~Å bumps detected in absorption along the lines of sight to distant background quasars. Here we describe our program strategy, and present MIRI MRS observations of IR dust features at $z=0.5-1.2$ in five quasar spectra that form the first part of our full sample. We identify artifacts in MIRI MRS data that affect the background in IFU cubes, and propose methods to reduce their effects. We pay special attention to modeling the quasar mid-IR continuum, which shows significant variation depending on AGN morphology, redshift, and black hole mass. Dust in foreground galaxies produces significant absorption from the 10~$μ$m silicate feature in all five quasar spectra. Compared with the average 10~$μ$m silicate feature in the diffuse ISM of the Milky Way, we find differences in the absorption peak position, width of the features, and asymmetry of the profiles. A detailed study of these silicate features is presented in our next paper (Klimenko et al. 2026b). In two quasar spectra, we tentatively detect weak IR features near 3.0 and 3.4~$μ$m. Their strengths are comparable to those seen in the Milky Way ISM, but follow-up observations are required to confirm these detections."}

The data reveal low-density ($n_\\mathrm{H_2}\\sim10^3~$cm$^{-3}$) molecular gas with inward motion, widespread both inside and outside the CND. The normalized [\\ion{C}{1}] to CS~7--6 intensity difference decreases inwardly from $R=4$~pc to 1.7~pc and azimuthally along the CND's rotation, likely tracing paths of low-density gas inflow. By projecting spaxels into orbital coordinates assuming a velocity field model, we identify four kinematic features: a pair of spiral outer streamers toward the CND, inner streamers extending to 0.5~pc from Sgr~A$^*$, an outer disk at $ R\\sim3$--6~pc, and the rotating ring at $R=2$~pc. $P$--$P$--$V$ correlation between the inner streamers and H42$α$ indicates gas supply to the mini-spiral through the western arc (WA) and northern arm (NA). The total inflowing mass is $1.5\\times10^4~M_\\odot$, 1.7 times the mass of the rotating ring. The identified flows can be organized into two main pathways connecting the CND exterior and interior: ``WA flow'' feeding the mini-spiral WA via the CND, and ``NA flow'' bypassing the purely rotating orbit. The inflow rate along the former is approximately constant (0.1--0.16~$M_\\odot~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), implying a CND dwelling time comparable to its orbital period and supporting the CND's transient nature. We also identify two [\\ion{C}{1}]-bright clumps (CBCs) lacking dense-gas counterparts near the contact point between the northern outer streamer and the CND. Apparently intact against tidal disruption despite subcritical densities, the CBCs may represent a chemically young phase shortly after formation in colliding flows."}

The sample consists mostly of core-dominated sources and quasars. Half of the targets have a UV luminosity $L_{\\rm UV} = 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, above this limit, the gas would be expected to be ionised by this radiation. We obtained 15 spectra free (or almost free) of radio frequency interference, reaching extremely low optical depths ($τ_{\\rm peak} < 0.005$) resulting in three new HI absorption detections. Two are associated HI absorptions, giving a detection rate of such systems of $13\\%\\pm 7\\%$. Both are found in young radio sources (PKS 1151-34 and PKS 1306-09), confirming the trend that this type of sources are more often detected in HI compared to more evolved ones. The UV luminosity of both these sources is below $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Surprisingly, one of the detections (PKS 1151-34) is hosted by a quasar, suggesting that the radio lobes are still embedded in the circumnuclear disc. In the second source (PKS 1306-09), the HI is highly blueshifted and likely part of a jet-driven outflow. A third detection is a 'local intervening' system, caused by a galaxy in the local environment of PKS 0405-12 and located in front of the southern radio lobe of this source, about 100 kpc in projection from this quasar. Overall, the results indicate a variety of plausible situations, which resemble what is seen at low redshifts. For the associated absorption, a combination of evolutionary status of the radio sources, physical conditions, and geometry of the gas structure determine the detection rate of HI absorption."}

Our aim is to determine molecular abundances and excitation conditions across a wide spectral range inaccessible to ground-based observatories. We utilize archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory, obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI). We report here the detection of high-excitation CO, 13CO, and C18O, H2O isotopologues, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CS, C34S, SO, SO2, H2CS, and CH3OH. CO, p-H2O, CS, and HCN show similar velocity profiles with a narrow, blueshifted component, which may be linked to the outer outflow layer. Redshifted wings may indicate inner outflow activity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework is employed to infer column densities and temperatures accurately. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the global physical parameters of G10, providing essential context for interpreting the molecular emission. The MCMC analysis revealed two excitation temperature components: a warm component (30-65 K) and a hot component (90-250 K). The higher temperatures indicate dense, hot gas typical of massive hot cores. The lower temperatures correspond to the warm, less dense envelope around the core. Transitions of H2O, high-excitation CO, and HCN indicate outflowing gas and high-density shocked regions. These findings highlight G10's complex dynamical environment."}

After the calibration and correction of the data, we obtained for each H II region the de-reddened fluxes in the aforementioned lines, the size, the Hα equivalent width, and, using two different empirical calibrations, the metallicity. Employing a method based on the Delaunay triangulation, a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the metallicity was obtained. Data for 209 H II regions of NGC 628 and 226 H II regions of NGC 6946 are obtained. The radial behaviours of the Hα equivalent width, the excitation, and the oxygen abundance are derived. Two-dimensional representations of the metallicity and the excitation are calculated for the galaxies in the study. The two empirical calibrations of the metallicity are compared. The oxygen abundance gradients obtained in this study agree with previously published values. However, more regions were examined than in previous studies. We find a difference of about 0.6 dex between the two empirical calibrations employed. Finally, the 2D representations of the metallicity reveal high metallicity knots in NGC 628, and for NGC 6946 a high metallicity azimuthal structure is discovered. These high metallicity regions seem to be linked to the arms of the galaxies and are probably produced by an increase in the temperature of the ionizing clusters in the H II regions, which may be linked to variations in the initial mass functions of the galaxies between the arm and interarm regions."}

From these data, we study ~140 million galaxies (8.29 galaxies/arcmin$^2$) that are 50% complete at i=24.0 and extend beyond z=1.2. We divide the galaxies into four redshift bins, and obtain cosmic shear measurement with a signal-to-noise of 83, a factor of 2 higher than the Year 3 analysis. We model the uncertainties due to shear and redshift calibrations, and discard measurements on small angular scales to mitigate baryon feedback and other small-scale uncertainties. We consider two fiducial models to account for the intrinsic alignment (IA) of the galaxies. We conduct a blind analysis in the context of the $Λ$CDM model and find $S_8 \\equiv σ_8(Ω_m/0.3)^{0.5}=0.798^{+0.014}_{-0.015}$ (marginalized mean with 68% CL) when using the non-linear alignment model (NLA) and $S_{8} = 0.783^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$ with the tidal alignment and tidal torque model (TATT), providing 1.8% and 2.5% uncertainty on $S_8$. Compared to constraints from the cosmic microwave background from Planck 2018, ACT DR6 and SPT-3G DR1, we find consistency in the full parameter space at 1.1$σ$ (1.7$σ$) and in $S_8$ at 2.0$σ$ (2.3$σ$) for NLA (TATT). The result using the NLA model is preferred according to the Bayesian evidence. We find that the model choice for IA and baryon feedback can impact the value of our $S_8$ constraint up to $1σ$. For our fiducial model choices, the resultant uncertainties in $S_8$ are primarily degraded by the removal of scales, as well as the marginalization over the IA parameters. We demonstrate that our result is internally consistent and robust to different choices in calibrating the data, owing to methodological improvements in shear and redshift measurement, laying the foundation for next-generation cosmic shear programs."}

Early results from a recent Submillimeter Array (SMA) survey of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) include the first detections of resolved dust continuum emission from individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in an external spiral galaxy. This paper updates on the now-complete SMA survey of 80 Herschel-identified giant molecular associations (GMAs) in M31. The SMA survey simultaneously probes dust continuum emission at 230 GHz and the $J = 2 \\rightarrow 1$ transitions of the CO isotopologues, $^{12}\\rm CO$, $^{13}\\rm CO$, and $\\rm C^{18}O$ at a spatial resolution of $\\lesssim 15~\\mathrm{pc}$. Dust continuum emission was detected in 71 cloud cores, of which 26 were resolved. This more than doubles the size of the previous sample. By comparing dust and CO observations with identical astrometry, we directly measure the dust mass to-light ratios, $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{^{12}CO}$, and $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{^{13}CO}$. We derive $<α^{\\prime}_{\\rm ^{12}\\rm CO}>~=~0.070~\\pm~0.031~M_{\\odot}\\,(\\rm K~km~s^{-1}~pc^{2})^{-1}$ and $<α^{\\prime}_{\\rm ^{13}\\rm CO}>~=~0.37~\\pm~0.20~M_{\\odot}\\,(\\rm K~km~s^{-1}~pc^{2})^{-1}$ for the increased sample, which are in agreement with previously reported values. From virial analysis, we find that 80% of the GMC regions traced by resolved dust emission are bound and close to virial equilibrium. Finally, we update our analysis on the metallicity dependence of $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{\\rm CO}$ by combining SMA observations with existing MMT/Hectospec optical spectroscopy toward H II regions. We find no trend in $\\rm α^{\\prime}_{\\rm CO}$ with metallicity, supporting the previous findings."}

While many viable constructions rely on non-canonical kinetic terms, non-minimal couplings, or modifications of gravity, it remains an open question whether comparably small tensor amplitudes can emerge within a minimal, single-field framework driven solely by potential dynamics. In this work we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on a modified Lennard-Jones potential. Inspired by a well-known interaction potential in molecular physics, the proposed form naturally combines a smooth minimum with an extended flat plateau at large field values. This intrinsic structure supports slow-roll inflation and ensures a graceful exit without introducing additional degrees of freedom. We perform a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics and confront the model with current observational constraints. We find that the scalar spectral index is fully consistent with CMB data, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be extremely small, reaching values as low as $r\\sim10^{-7}$. Finally, the running of the scalar spectral index is also found to be small, well withing the 1$σ$ recent observational bounds from Atacama Cosmology Telescope."}

This manuscript develops a modified version of the GRAS/AQUAL field equation that can be extended to galaxy clusters. It involves just a single free parameter. The new field equation is then applied to a sample of galaxy clusters and checked against modeled galaxies and solar system constraints. Further to this, the modified field equation leads to an understanding of the difference between the galactic RAR and the RAR recently found for clusters."}

The most massive black holes grow to masses of $\\sim10^{6}$ M$_\\odot$ by $z=12.5$ during short bursts of super-Eddington accretion, sustained over a period of 5-30 Myr. We find that the determining factor that cuts off this initial growth is feedback from the MBH itself, rather than nearby supernovae or exhausting the available gas reservoir. Our simulations show that for the most actively accreting MBHs, feedback completely evacuates the gas from the host halo and ejects it into the inter-galactic medium. Despite implementing a relatively weak feedback model, the energy injected into the gas surrounding the MBH exceeds the binding energy of the halo. These results either indicate that MBH feedback in the early ($Λ$CDM) Universe is much weaker than previously assumed, or that at least some of the high redshift galaxies we currently observe with JWST formed via a two-step process, whereby a MBH initially quenches its host galaxy and later reconstitutes its baryonic reservoir, either through mergers with gas rich galaxies or from accretion from the cosmic web. Moreover, the maximum black hole masses that emerge in SEEDZ are effectively set by a combination of MBH feedback modelling and the binding potential of the host halo. Unless feedback is extremely ineffective at early times (for example if growth is merger dominated rather than accretion dominated or feedback is contained close to the MBH) then the maximum mass of black holes at redshift before 12.5 should not significantly exceed $10^6$ M$_\\odot$."}

Protostellar jets are widely invoked as the primary channels for angular momentum removal, yet the mechanism by which they are launched and extract angular momentum remains poorly constrained. Here we report high-resolution ALMA Band 7 (345 GHz) and Band 6 (230 GHz) observations of CO (3-2), CO (2-1), and SiO (5-4) emission from the protostar HOPS 10 (G209.55-19.68S2). The combined data trace both the entrained outflow and the collimated jet with excellent spatial and velocity resolution, revealing a uniquely monopolar protostellar jet, the clearest example reported to date. The system exhibits a distinctly unipolar high-velocity jet with velocity offsets of +44 to +66 km s-1, unlike the predominantly bipolar morphology characteristic of most protostellar jets. While the low-velocity outflow, with velocity offsets of -20 to +30 km s-1, is detected in both directions, the high-velocity jet appears only on one side, and this monopolarity is consistent across all tracers. Given the nearly edge-on geometry and low submillimeter extinction, comparable emission would normally be expected from both lobes. The shock tracer SiO emission confirms a genuine, highly collimated jet rather than cloud contamination, and no ambient structure is capable of obscuring a counterjet. We argue that intrinsically asymmetric mass loading along the disk magnetic field lines provides the most plausible explanation for the observed monopolarity."}

Paper 1 is Mingarelli (2026a)", "summary": "Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) formed in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are expected to inspiral into their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), generating a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background in the mHz--decihertz band. Using the population-agnostic energetic formalism, we treat the AGN-disk channel as a mass-flow pipeline connecting the stellar-mass black hole population observed by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) to the SMBH mass reservoir via IMBHs. By anchoring this estimate to the LVK merger rate densities and the cosmic SMBH mass density derived from scaling relations, we derive a limit on the background amplitude. We show that the total energy density of the background is bounded by the global mass budget of SMBH growth. For fiducial parameters consistent with the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4), this yields a characteristic strain $A_{\\rm IMR} \\simeq (1.2_{-0.2}^{+0.2})\\times 10^{-21}$ at $3\\,{\\rm mHz}$. While this fiducial amplitude is subdominant to the Galactic white dwarf foreground and the stellar-mass Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) background, we show it can be distinguished by its non-Gaussian statistics and higher frequency cutoff. This new background may be detectable in the decihertz band where proposed detectors such as the Big Bang Observer or long-baseline lunar interferometers can measure it cleanly. A detection would provide a direct, model-independent constraint on the efficiency with which AGN disks process stellar remnants into SMBH mass growth, linking the LVK and LISA bands."}

In the present paper, we define a global entropy using a statistical approach that accounts for the contributions of both matter particles and photons. The statistical contribution of radiation is described as a photon gas in the definition of this global entropy. The increase in global entropy can foster structure formation -- rather than disorder -- because structures such as stars and galaxies are efficient at dissipating energy in the form of photons, and thus at producing entropy. We show that stars generate a nearly equal amount of specific entropy, and therefore a comparable number of photons per unit mass, over their lifetime on the main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. This suggests that the main sequence of the HR diagram constitutes a locus of convergence toward a universal specific entropy production by stars. We then examine the implications of this approach for the star-formation main sequence in galaxies, and find a similar result. The emergence of organized structures in cosmic history reflects the second law, as organized matter is efficient at generating entropy through the slicing of energy into lower-frequency photons. This is also reflected in the dominant contribution of low-frequency photons to the extragalactic background light. Finally, we briefly discuss how this perspective may inform us on the possibility of the existence of life elsewhere in the universe."}

Using Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) data, we detect extended radio emission extending outwards to the galactic axis, with a steep non-thermal spectral index ($α= -1.2 \\pm 0.2$) indicative of synchrotron radiation from an AGN jet. The jet has a physical extent of $\\approx 8.2\\,kpc$ (angular length of $64^{\\prime\\prime}$). Multi-wavelength data from The Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey 2 (DECaPS2), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) provide further support for this interpretation. The colour-colour diagram presenting WISE infrared observations suggests the presence of dust and young stars that trace the galaxy's disk structure. Our analysis reveals a radio jet, alongside star formation traced by infrared emission, demonstrating the complex interplay of AGN activity and star formation in this well-resolved galaxy. Intriguingly, the spatial relationship reveals the brighter X-ray emission to be largely adjacent to and enveloping the extended radio emission. This suggests that the radio jet, while extending at a significant angle to the galactic disk, is confined by the larger X-ray gas halo, similar to other systems (i.e., ESO 295-IG022, Centaurus A) and may indicate jet collimation and channelling effects."}

Covering the full optical range (3600-9800 Å) over a contiguous ~ 0.5 degree field, the LVM data provide the first hexagonally sampled, wide-field emission-line maps of all major ionic species in this archetypal planetary nebula. The resulting flux, kinematic, and line-ratio maps reveal the well-known ionization stratification of the nebula, from the compact He++ core to the bright [O III] ring and the extended low-ionization envelope, enabling a detailed comparison with classical aperture spectroscopy. Owing to the sensitivity and uniform spatial sampling of the LVM, numerous faint auroral and diagnostic lines are detected across the nebula, including [O III] 4363, [N II] 5755, and He I lines, allowing precise measurements of weak-line morphology. The derived radial trends confirm the remarkably low dust content and the overall homogeneity of electron temperature and density across the main ring. Ionized-gas kinematics traced by Hα further support the scenario of a slowly expanding, limb-brightened shell consistent with previous studies.

This work aims to derive the physical properties of the circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) using MUSE integral field spectroscopy observations. A total of 24 individual ionised HII are identified and analysed within its ring, which spans from $\\sim$385 pc to $\\sim$1.3 kpc. Despite the complex nuclear activity, all HII regions are found to be purely photoionised.

In this high-metallicity regime, we find a break in the ionisation parameter-[SII]/[SIII] relation, which can be explained by changes in the ionisation structure and line emissivities, as confirmed by photoionisation models that successfully reproduce the observed emission-line ratios. Our results also indicate that the local gas supply regulates the star formation activity within the ring, with the young stars ionising 8 % of the total gas in the ring. Furthermore, our findings support a propagating starburst scenario, originating in the galaxy nucleus and extending towards the ends of the bar and into the circumnuclear ring through bar-driven shocks, this being consistent with the results of previous multi-wavelength studies. Finally, we likely detect optical signatures associated with one of the two known jets in this galaxy. This finding, together with the radio core emission previously found at sub-parsec scales, reflects the presence of feedback processes operating even on small galactic disc scales."}
