We investigate the IRDC G035.39-00.33 using SiO, H13CO+, CH3OH, and CS emission observed with ALMA at 3.5\\arcsec\\ resolution (0.05 pc). The SiO emission traces shock activity within the cloud, providing insights into current star formation and cloud formation mechanisms. We identify several regions with broad SiO emission clearly associated with outflows, pinpointing the locations of ongoing star formation across the cloud. The ALMA images also reveal a series of spatially extended SiO emission spots with narrow line profiles, aligned along an arc-like path that is also seen in CS and CH3OH emission. While the broad SiO emission is mainly associated with the main cloud filament, as seen in visual extinction, the narrow SiO arch is located at the edge of the cloud, far from the identified sites of star formation activity. The presence of these arc-like morphologies suggests that large-scale shocks may have compressed the gas in the surroundings of the G035.39-00.33 cloud, shaping its filamentary structure. By inspecting the large-scale radio continuum emission around G035.39-00.33, we find that this IRDC is part of a larger star-forming complex where the densest and coolest material appears at the interacting regions between a Supernova Remnant (SNR) and an expanding HII region. In particular, we hypothesize that this IRDC may be spatially coincident with the ionized expanding gas associated with the previously identified SNR G35.6-0.4. We suggest that collisions between giant molecular clouds and expanding gas flows from interacting SNRs and HII regions may be responsible for the observed arc-like structures. Such shock compressions could play an important role in the formation of IRDCs and in the potential triggering of star formation."}

Our size-velocity dispersion relationship agrees with those of Milky Way (MW) and M31 clouds. The slope of our size-mass relationship is shallower than those in clouds and cloud complexes of the MW. We find offsets between the isosurfaces of the clouds and star formation rate (SFR) peaks in M31, supporting the scenario where the evolutionary state of individual sources plays a role in the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law at parsec scales.

The cosmic chronometers (CC) method offers a unique opportunity to directly measure the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ without relying on any cosmological model assumptions or integrated distance measurements. Despite its potential, this technique remains statistics-limited: no current survey is optimized to detect large samples of CC, restricting the precision on $H(z)$ to $\\sim$20% at intermediate redshifts. Here, we investigate the opportunities that a next-generation spectroscopic facility could offer to CC studies, providing an estimate of the accuracy achievable on the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter in redshift.

The usual explanation requires large amounts of unseen dark matter. Here, we introduce an empirical law in which spacetime itself appears to store additional energy when distorted by baryonic matter. The baryonic potential $Φ_b$ made by the baryonic energy density $ρ_b$ generates an additional energy density $ρ_s = μ_s Φ_b^2 / c^4$, leading to a Poisson equation for the total potential $Φ_{\\rm tot}$, \\[ \\nabla^2Φ_{\\rm tot} = 4πG\\,ρ_b /c^2 + 4πG\\,μ_s\\,Φ_b^2 / c^6. \\] When assuming $μ_s = K M_b^{-3/2}$ with a parameter $K$, we applied this equation to 91 galaxies from the SPARC database. The model reproduced quite well both the inner rise and outer flat regions of the observed rotation curves using the observed baryonic mass profiles only. The $K$ values for the 91 galaxies were found to be concentrated within a narrow range. These results suggest that dark matter is directly connected to the baryonic gravitational potential. A theoretical interpretation of the empirical law is also discussed, in which a relation between the additional energy and the cosmological constant is implied."}

Obs. Skalnaté Pleso", "summary": "We present observational evidence supporting the presence of a stratified accretion disk wind in active galactic nuclei (AGN), based on multi-wavelength spectroscopic analysis of broad and narrow emission lines. The diversity in emission line profiles, ionization potentials, and kinematic signatures suggests a structured outflow emerging from the accretion disk, with different zones contributing to specific spectral features. High-ionization lines (e.g., Civ λ1549) exhibit strong blueshifts and asymmetric profiles indicative of fast, inner winds, while low-ionization lines (e.g., H\\b{eta}, Mgii λ 2800) show more symmetric profiles consistent with predominant emission from slower, denser regions farther out, although exhibiting systematic blueshifts in quasars radiating at high Eddington ratios. The intermediate ionization lines (e.g., Aliii λ1860) present a situation that is intermediate in terms of shift amplitudes, although in several super-Eddington candidates radial outflow velocity may reach values comparable to the ones of the high ionization lines. These results are consistent with radiatively driven wind models featuring radial stratification. We made preliminary photoionization modeling assuming unabsorbed radiation emitted from the corona and the hotter disk regions emission or absorbed by a layer of gas. Our findings provide new constraints on the geometry and physical conditions of AGN winds, providing clear evidence in favor of stratified wind emission."}

However, the signal is extremely faint and contaminated by gravitational lensing, instrumental noise, and astrophysical foregrounds. Here we present a score-based diffusion approach, formulated using variance-exploding stochastic differential equations (VE-SDEs), to reconstruct the primordial B-mode angular power spectrum from contaminated observations. The method employs a reverse SDE guided by a score model trained exclusively on random realizations of the primordial low $\\ell$ B-mode angular power spectrum corresponding to a fixed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.001$. During inference, the reverse SDE iteratively drives the observed angular power spectrum toward the learned primordial manifold, effectively denoising and delensing the input. The model is tested on simulated observational spectra that include gravitational lensing, complex polarized foreground combinations, and instrumental noise characteristics representative of the proposed ECHO mission. The trained score model learns the underlying statistical distribution of the primordial B-mode field for the given $r$, which acts as a physics-guided prior that can generate new, consistent realizations of the signal. This approach provides a robust framework for primordial signal recovery in future CMB polarization missions."}

The collapse of significant density perturbations originating from large primordial scalar fluctuations generated during inflation can lead to the formation of primordial black holes. In our study, we adopt the Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini model as our framework, in which the inflaton field and the Palatini curvature are non-minimally coupled. To achieve our objective, we analyze the behavior of the primordial curvature power spectrum, which exhibits a large enhancement at small scales corresponding to large wavenumbers $k$. Furthermore, we examine the probability of PBHs formation by studying the mass variance, $σ(M_{PBH})$, and the mass fraction of the total energy density collapsing into PBHs, $β(M_{PBH})$. The evolution of both functions is consistent with current observational constraints. Finally, we investigate the abundance of primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We found that they can account for the totality or a fraction of the current dark matter content, depending primarily on the values of the coupling constant and the e-folds number."}
