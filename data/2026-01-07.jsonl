Such objects are dark and thus challenging to characterise, but they can be studied via gravitational lensing. Recently, a million-solar-mass object was discovered superposed on an extended and extremely thin gravitational arc. Here we report on extensive tests of various assumptions for the mass density profile and redshift of this object. We find models that best describe the data have two components: an unresolved point-mass of radius $\\leq10$ pc centred on an extended mass distribution with an almost constant surface density out to a truncation radius of 139 pc. These properties do not resemble any known astronomical object. However, if the object is dark matter-dominated, its structure is incompatible with cold dark matter models, but may be compatible with a self-interacting dark matter halo where the central region has collapsed to form a black hole. This detection could thus carry substantial implications for our current understanding of dark matter."}

Recent advances in imaging and shear estimation have pushed reliable reduced shear measurements closer to cluster cores, making mass reconstruction accessible in the nonlinear regime. However, the Kaiser-Squires based algorithm becomes unstable in cluster cores, where convergence $κ$ significantly deviates from zero and the linear approximation breaks down. To address this limitation, we develop a reconstruction framework with two key modifications: applying smooth masks to these regions and using a model-derived analytical solution as the initial guess, rather than assuming $κ= 0$. We validate our framework using simulated cluster lensing data with known mass distributions, incorporating realistic masks that arise from limitations in reduced shear measurements. We show that in the absence of shape noise, our framework yields high-fidelity mass reconstruction in regions of large reduced shear, with the best-performing method achieving residuals below $0.02 σ$ in the unmasked regions. This pushes mass reconstruction to higher accuracy in the nonlinear regime."}

Such objects are unexpected, since theoretical studies have not predicted the existence of detectable galaxies at $z\\sim30$. While any $z\\sim30$ candidates may be contaminants at lower redshifts, we explore whether such extreme redshift sources could be consistent with hyper-energetic transient events linked to the formation of the first, metal-free, stars. Specifically, we consider pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), a predicted class of extreme thermonuclear explosions that leave no remnant behind. Using cosmological simulations, we investigate an overdense cosmic region, where star formation and subsequent PISNe occur at $z\\sim30-40$, even within standard cosmology. Assessing the likelihood of such a region, the corresponding number of PISNe at $z\\gtrsim20$, and their observed flux, we find that JWST has a non-negligible chance to detect a PISN event at extremely high redshifts.

This serves as an accurate alternative to the more computationally demanding bare estimator that uses all baselines and frequency channels. Further, we employ a non-parametric foreground-subtraction method based on Gaussian process regression, which minimizes loss of the HI 21-cm signal and yields improved signal-to-noise ratios.

Finally, we apply a Bayesian likelihood framework with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to the residual visibilities to recover ionized bubble properties, including radius, position, and the mean neutral fraction.

For this purpose, hydrodynamic simulations were performed using the GADGET-4 code, with initial conditions generated by the Galstep and SnapshotJoiner programs. Systems of two galaxies on a head-on collision course were modeled with relative initial velocities ranging from 100 km/s to 1000 km/s, considering two scenarios: the first with identical galaxies, and the second with galaxies of different sizes. In simulations of systems with higher initial relative velocities, both found more intense peaks in the star formation rate, triggered by the first contact of the collision, followed by a strong decline caused by gas dispersion. In contrast, for systems with lower initial velocities, mergers between galaxies were observed, leading to multiple peaks in the star formation rate. A greater initial distance between galaxies has also been linked to whether or not the galaxy system merges, since it implies longer timescales for gravitational action, which leads to higher relative velocities at the moment of collision. Furthermore, the star formation rate in galaxies was found to have a clear dependence on initial gas content. Furthermore, the initial gas content in galaxies was found to have a clear dependence on star formation rates. Overall, our results show that the relative impact velocity, the initial distance between the galaxies, and the gas content are important parameters for analyzing the star formation rate in colliding galaxies."}

By removing angular momentum, shocks in gas cause inflows, which can trigger nuclear star formation and fuel AGN activity. To identify the signatures of extended shocks, we examine residual velocity fields after subtracting a modelled rotating disc, and we study velocity difference between various gas tracers. Combining our kinematic analysis with BPT ionisation diagnostic maps and dust morphology, we find that 11 of 21 galaxies ($\\sim$52%) show extended shock signatures with velocity jumps consistent with models of bar-driven shocks. This is likely a lower limit, as three additional galaxies ($\\sim$15%) exhibit shocks along bars, potentially reaching the nucleus but obscured by AGN outflows. We trace shock signatures inwards close to the resolution limit, which suggests that shocks may be the prevailing mechanism of inflow in the central kpc of galaxies. The only two unbarred galaxies in our sample are also the only systems with unperturbed kinematics and no shocks, strongly linking the perturbed gas dynamics in centres of galaxies to the presence of bars. All galaxies with inner bars show LINER- or Seyfert-like nuclear emission, whereas galaxies without inner bars exhibit all emission types, indicating that regardless of gas supply, inner bars suppress star formation in galactic nuclei."}

This motivates cross-correlations, to ascertain the cosmological nature of measured HI fluctuations, and to study their connections with galaxies and the underlying matter density field. However, these same foregrounds render the cross-correlation with projected fields such as the lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) difficult. Indeed, the correlated Fourier modes vary slowly along the line of sight, and are thus most contaminated by the smooth-spectrum radio continuum foregrounds. In this paper, we implement a method that avoids this issue by attempting to measure the non-linear gravitational coupling of the small-scale 21cm power from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) with large-scale Planck CMB lensing. This measurement is a position-dependent power spectrum, i.e. a squeezed integrated bispectrum. Using 94 nights of CHIME data between $1.0 < z < 1.3$ and aggressive foreground filtering, we find that the expected signal is five times smaller than the current noise. We forecast that incorporating the additional nights of CHIME data already collected would enable a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, without any further improvements in filtering for foreground cleaning."}

However, the physical mechanisms governing subhalo spin acquisition within the tidal environments of host halos remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the alignment between subhalo and host halo spins using the high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, Shin-Uchuu. We find that the spin alignment between subhalos and host halos becomes increasingly pronounced toward the central regions. Our analysis reveals that subhalos typically acquire spin in the same direction as their orbital angular momentum. Since the orbital angular momentum of most subhalos is aligned with the host halo spin, an overall alignment between subhalo and host spins emerges. When classified by orbital orientation, however, subhalo spins in the inner regions are found to be oriented perpendicularly or anti-parallel to the host spin for polar and retrograde orbits, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that subhalo spins are acquired through torques exerted by the tidal field of the host halo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mass ratio and the radial distance from the host center are the primary parameters governing subhalo spin alignment, while the dependence on the accretion redshift is found to be negligible."}

The thin dust disk's scale height increases radially from 60 to 200 pc, while the thick disk grows from 300 to 800 pc.

In four galaxies (ESO 428-G14, NGC 4388, NGC 3081, and NGC 5728), we detect spatially resolved dust structures extending ~100-200 pc along the NLR. In these systems, we find a strong link between the morphology of the dust, the radio ejecta, and the coronal [Si VI] emission, implying that dust carries imprints of the processes shaping the NLR. Using spatially resolved spectral energy distributions, we show that dust in the NLR has systematically steeper slopes than star forming clumps. This dust emits at temperatures in the range 150 - 220 K, at a distance of ~150 pc from the nucleus. Using simple models, we show that, even under optimistic assumptions of grain size and AGN luminosity, the excess MIR emission cannot be explained by AGN illumination alone. We interpret this excess heating as in-situ. We show that shocks with velocities of $v_{\\rm shock} \\sim 200- 400 \\, \\rm km/s$ in dense gas can close this gap, and in some cases even account for the total observed emission. This, combined with multiple lines of evidence for shocks in these regions, supports a scenario in which shocks not only coexist with dust but may be playing a key role in heating it.

We classify the absorption systems based on whether they display only low-ionization absorption (CII, SiII, MgII), only high-ionization absorption (CIV, SiIV), or both. The percentage of low-ionization-only systems decreases from 24% at $z\\sim$6 to 2% at $z\\sim$4.3, whilst the fraction of high-ionization-only systems increases from 52% to 82%. For mixed absorbers (with both low and high ionization absorption), we use the column density ratios log(N_CII/N_CIV) and log(N_SiII/N_SiIV) to quantify the average ionization as a function of redshift. The log(N_SiII/N_SiIV) ratio does not change significantly over 5$\\lesssim z \\lesssim$6.3. We combine the E-XQR-30 log(N_CII/N_CIV) measurements with literature measurements at $z\\sim$2-4 and find that the log(N_CII/N_CIV) ratio declines by a factor of $\\sim$20 between $z\\sim$6 and $z\\sim$2. To explore possible drivers of this evolution, we run photoionization models of gas slabs illuminated by a uniform UV background at fixed density, metallicity and HI column density. We find that the increase in the ionization state of metal absorbers towards lower redshifts can likely be explained by some combination of 1) an increase in the metallicity of CIV-absorbing gas and 2) a decrease in the typical HI column densities of the absorbing gas, driven by the declining cosmic mean density and a rapid rise in the strength of the UV background during the final stages of reionization."}

These systems, which include polar rings, polar disks, polar halos, polar bulges, polar dust lanes, and polar tidal structures, provide valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution, although their rarity has limited statistical studies. We aim to construct the largest and most homogeneous catalog of PSGs to date in order to enable robust statistical studies of their properties and occurrence rates in the local Universe. Using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR10) data, we identified PSG candidates in the Siena Galaxy Atlas (SGA) through visual inspection, convolutional neural network classification, and cross-matching with previously reported systems. Each galaxy was assigned a PSG subtype and host morphology. We analyzed general properties of PSGs and compared them with those for all galaxies in the SGA. Simple image simulations were used to evaluate projection effects. The resulting Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (COUGS-DESI) contains 2,989 PSG candidates, including 342 previously known objects. Projection effects from random galaxy overlaps are negligible. The sample spans a wide range of polar morphologies, with 1,113 polar rings, 75 polar bulges, 216 polar halos, 185 polar dust lanes, and 1,315 polar tidal structures. PSGs constitute 2.2% of local non-dwarf galaxies, with polar rings representing 0.7%. Approximately 1% of S0 galaxies in the SGA host polar rings, whereas spirals constitute the most common morphological type among the PSG hosts in our catalog. COUGS--DESI increases the number of known PSG candidates by an order of magnitude and provides a foundation for detailed studies of the formation and evolution of polar structures."}

Using $\\approx$1.1 million quasar spectra from SDSS DR16 and the DESI Early Data Release, we identify 1345 unique GOTOQs over the redshift range $0.0045 \\leq z \\leq 1.09$, more than quadrupling the number previously known. The catalogue combines both absorption agnostic and absorption selected searches, enabling a statistically robust characterization of gas in galaxies at projected separations $D \\lesssim 20$ kpc. The GOTOQ emission line ratios indicate that their host galaxies are predominantly normal, star forming disks with typical dust extinctions of $A_V \\approx 0.5$ mag. We measure the MgII covering fraction at $D \\lesssim 20$ kpc and find it to be remarkably high, $f_c = 98.2^{+1.3}_{-4.5}$ per cent, indicating that these systems trace gas rich, metal enriched regions at the disk halo interface. The median colour excess towards the quasar line of sight, $E(B-V) = 0.087$, is significantly higher than that of typical MgII absorbers, underscoring the dust rich nature of GOTOQ sightlines. From a high signal to noise composite spectrum, we report the first statistical detection of the diffuse interstellar band at $λ4428$ ($W_r = 0.055 \\pm 0.011$ angstrom), revealing the presence of complex organic molecules at the disk halo interface. This catalogue provides a powerful reference sample for future multi wavelength studies of gas flows, cold gas, and dust evolution in the inner circumgalactic medium."}

All comments are welcome", "summary": "Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2) suggests that the dark energy in our universe might be evolving, favoring the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization and a lower Hubble constant. In our previous work, it has been reported that cosmological model with the non-singular bounce inflation (BI) scenario and $Λ$CDM might alleviate the Hubble tension into 3$σ$ confidence. In this paper, we study the cosmological model of BI with a dynamical dark energy. We find that individual consideration of the CPL parameterization and the data \\texttt{DESI DR2} tend to larger Hubble constants for both BI and power law (PL) case with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Employing BI with combined CPL parameterization and \\texttt{DESI DR2}, we obtain the Hubble constant $H_ 0 = 65.2^{ + 1.8}_{ - 2.2} \\ \\mathrm{km} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \\cdot \\mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$, which is larger than $H_ 0 = 64.0 \\pm 2.1 \\ \\mathrm{km} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \\cdot \\mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$ for the PL case. After considering nontrivial weak lensing effect and spatial curvature as well as adding \\texttt{Pantheon+}, BI fits 3.1$σ$ confidence of $Λ$CDM with $w_ 0 = -0.919 \\pm 0.038$ and $w_{ \\mathrm{a}} = -0.37 \\pm 0.12$, and it prefers evolving dark energy than the PL case with $w_ 0 = -0.960 \\pm 0.074$ and $w_{ \\mathrm{a}} = -0.15^{ +0.28}_{ -0.25}$."}

Smith Telescope. The source was originally discovered in the UKIRT Wide-field Infrared Survey for Fe+ (UWIFE; Lee et al. 2014). Our spectra reveal multiple kinematic components in the [Fe II] 1.644 um emission. The high-velocity components exhibit elevated [Fe II]/Br gamma ratios characteristic of shock excitation, while the low-velocity components are dominated by hydrogen and helium recombination lines and are consistent with photoionized gas, indicating an H II-region origin. G25.8+0.2 lies within the G26 complex, a large (~15'x 30', corresponding to ~28 pc x 57 pc at a distance of 6.5 kpc) star-forming region in the inner Galaxy. The shock-excited [Fe II] filaments closely trace the morphology of the bright radio shell that partially encloses centrally filled soft X-ray emission, strongly suggesting recent supernova activity in this region. We discuss the physical nature of G25.8+0.2 and its relationship to the surrounding G26 star-forming complex. In addition, we derive the extinction toward the source using Brackett-line ratios and constrain the spectral types of the dominant ionizing stars from the He I 2.058 um/Br gamma line ratios."}

We examine patterns in [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] in FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. Out of 16 galaxies, 4 are capable of producing a strongly bimodal distribution. In all four galaxies, the high-$α$ population corresponds to an older, radially-compact, thick disk, and the low-$α$ population corresponds to a younger, radially-extended, thin disk, similar to the MW.The transition from high- to low-$α$ took $0.3-1.2\\Gyr$ and began $5.5-6.5\\Gyr$ ago. [Mg/Fe] decreased at relatively fixed [Fe/H], both in the galaxy overall and at fixed radii: Fe enrichment nearly balanced gas accretion (and therefore dilution), but Mg enrichment was weaker. Importantly, this transition occurred during a period of relatively low gas fraction ($5-15\\%$), immediately after a rapid decline in star formation (halving within a few hundred Myr), which caused an increase in Fe-producing white-dwarf supernovae relative to Mg-producing core-collapse supernovae. Only one case coincided with a major merger coalescence. We find similar trends in measuring stars by their current radius and by their birth radius, therefore, radial redistribution did not play a dominant role in the formation of a bimodality or its spatial dependence today. Overall, in FIRE-2, strong $α$-element bimodalities are relatively uncommon ($\\sim25\\%$), often not associated with a major merger, and arise primarily from a rapid decline in star formation during relatively low gas fraction."}

We consider a set of five linear and three non-linear IDE scenarios, encompassing both interactions proportional to the dark matter and/or dark energy densities, as well as non-linear combinations of the two. For all eight IDE models, we find a better fit than $Λ$CDM from a $Δχ^2$ analysis for both combinations of datasets considered. When using the Akaike Information Criterion ($Δ$AIC), we find a similarly improved fit in all cases, except for one dataset combination in $Q=3Hδρ_{\\rm de}$. Our analysis also shows a preference for sign-switching interactions, with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter at low redshift, reversing direction at higher redshift. These results should be interpreted with caution, as the latter direction of energy transfer is accompanied by negative dark energy densities in the past, which may be unphysical. Models that do not allow sign-changing behaviour instead show a preference for energy flow from dark matter to dark energy, and hence negative dark energy densities. The only exceptions are $Q=3Hδρ_{\\rm de}$ and $Q=3Hδ\\left(\\tfrac{ρ_{\\rm de}^2}{ρ_{\\rm dm}+ρ_{\\rm de}}\\right)$, which exhibit energy flow in the opposite direction. Furthermore, for all interactions considered, we find a phantom-divide crossing in the effective dark energy equation of state $w^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm de}$, with the dark energy density decreasing ($w^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm de}>-1$) at present and at low redshift, while increasing ($w^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm de}<-1$) in the past at high redshift. These results highlight the promising, but problematic, nature of dark sector interactions, as well as the need to extend the analysis using early-time physics and datasets."}
