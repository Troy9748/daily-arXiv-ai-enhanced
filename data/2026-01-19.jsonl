For a diffraction-limited PSF, as arises in space-based missions, this correction depends on each galaxy SED. In the Euclid mission, galaxy SED reconstruction, a tasks of the photometric-redshift processing function (PHZ PF), relies on broad- and medium-band ancillary photometry. The limited wavelength sampling of the Euclid VIS passband and signal-to-noise ratio may affect the reconstruction accuracy and translate into biases in the weak lensing measurements. In this study, we present the methodology, which is employed in the Euclid PHZ PF, for reconstructing galaxy SEDs at 55 wavelengths, sampling the VIS passband every 10 nm, and we assess whether it fulfils the accuracy requirements imposed on the Euclid PSF model. We employ both physics- and data-driven methods, focusing on a new approach of template-based flux correction and Gaussian processes, and we introduce an SED metric whose bias propagates into PSF quadrupole moment errors. Our findings demonstrate that Gaussian processes and template fitting meet the requirements only in specific, but complementary, redshift intervals. We therefore propose a hybrid approach, which leverages both methods. This solution proves to be effective in meeting the Euclid accuracy requirements for most of the redshift range of the survey. Finally, we investigate the impact on the SED reconstruction of a new set of 16 evenly-spaced medium-band filters for the Subaru telescope, providing quasi-spectroscopic coverage of the VIS passband. This study shows promising results, ensuring accurate SED reconstruction and meeting the mission PSF requirements. This work thus provides not only the methodological foundation of galaxy SED reconstruction in the Euclid PHZ PF, but also a roadmap for future improvements using a new medium-band survey."}

Although previously identified as one of the most distant dynamically relaxed systems based on X-ray morphological statistics, we find compelling evidence that SPT-CL J2215-3537 displays some level of dynamical activity. This includes temperature anisotropies consistent with the first detection of a pair of core-sloshing cold fronts at z > 1. We identify a ghost cavity candidate and estimate its mechanical power as log10(Pcav/10^42 erg s^-1) = 2.66 +- 0.23, confirming that radiative cooling strongly exceeds active galactic nucleus feedback heating. We show that SPT-CL J2215-3537 is likely in a short transient phase preceding the onset of a self-regulated cooling-feedback cycle. We recalculate traditional X-ray morphological parameters and discuss how non-self-similar evolution of parameters sensitive to the surface brightness cuspiness can bias dynamical classifications at high redshift."}

We find that the extrapolated linear density contrast computed from the spherical collapse model is suppressed when the strength of momentum transfer is increased. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, the cluster number counts are computed. The minimum mass limit in the mass integration for each redshift bin is determined by matching the predicted number counts from the $Λ$CDM model with the result from eROSITA surveys. We find that the number of clusters is maximal at a higher redshift bin, and the number of clusters in a maximum redshift bin is enhanced when the strength of momentum and energy transfers increases due to the reduction of extrapolated linear density contrast. Setting the parameters of the dark energy model with momentum coupling according to the observational constraints in \\cite{bestfit}, the predicted number counts from the coupled dark energy is larger than the result from eROSITA surveys. The statistical analysis yields a $p$-value of 0.189 for the proposed model relative to $Λ$CDM. Consequently, there is no statistically significant evidence of an improved fit over the standard $Λ$CDM framework based on the eROSITA cluster number counts."}

They are generally photon energy converters, absorbing short wavelength radiation and emitting long wavelength radiation. Sixty years ago in 1965, thermal emission from dust grains in the interstellar medium was discovered. This tutorial is a summary of the physics of thermal dust continuum emission and how to use observations of the intensity and flux density of dusty objects to calculate physical properties such as mass, column density, luminosity, dust temperature, and dust opacity spectral index. Equations are derived, when feasible, from first principles with all limits and assumptions explicitly stated. Properties of dust opacities appropriate for different astrophysical environments (e.g. diffuse ISM, dense cores, protoplanetary disks) are discussed and tabulated for the wavelengths of past, current, and future bolometer cameras. Corrections for observations at high redshift as well as the effects of telescope measurement limitations are derived. We also update the calculation of the mean molecular weight in different ISM environments and find that it is 1.404 per H atom, 2.809 per H2 molecule, and 2.351 per gas particle assuming protosolar metallicity and the latest values of the ISM gas phase abundances of metals."}

A DM-only run counterpart of Auriga allows us to compare results with and without baryons. We repopulate the original suites with low-mass subhalos orders of magnitude lighter than the mass resolution limit, starting from a detailed characterization of Auriga data in the well-resolved subhalo mass range. The survival of low-mass subhalos to tidal forces is unclear and under debate nowadays, thus in our study we stay agnostic and consider two different levels of subhalo resilience to tidal stripping ('fragile' and 'resilient' subhalos). We find baryons to alter the Galactic substructure significantly, by decreasing its overall abundance by a factor $\\sim2.4$ (fragile) and $\\sim1.9$ (resilient) and subhalo concentration -- here defined in terms of maximum circular velocity -- by $\\sim1.5$ with respect to the DM-only scenario. This has important consequences for indirect searches of DM. As an example, we investigated the case of using unidentified gamma-ray sources to set constraints on the DM particle properties, assuming some of them may be dark satellites. We find the DM annihilation cross-section constraints to worsen by a factor $\\sim3.6$ in the most realistic scenario of including baryons, compared to DM-only simulations in the 'fragile' setup. Yet, a stronger resilience of subhalos to tidal stripping improves these DM limits by a factor $\\sim4.5$ and $\\sim10$ compared to the DM-only and hydrodynamical 'fragile' cases, respectively. Our results show the importance of including baryons to properly characterize the Galactic subhalo population, as well as to propose the most optimal subhalo search strategies, not only via its potential DM annihilation products but also through their gravitational signatures."}

Large-scale imaging surveys present unprecedented opportunities to expand the sample of cluster lenses. In this study, we adopt a deep learning-based approach to identify cluster lenses from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, utilizing the catalog of galaxy cluster candidates identified by Zou et al. (2021). Our lens-finder employs a ResNet-18 architecture, trained with mock images of cluster lenses as positives and observational images of cluster scale non-lenses as negatives. We do an iterative operation to increase the completeness of our work, namely adding the found true positive samples back to the training set and training again for several times. Human inspection is conducted to further refine the candidates, categorizing them into grades (A, B, C) according to the significance of the strongly lensed arcs. Reviewing all 540,432 objects in Zou's catalog, we discover 485 high-confidence cluster lens candidates with a cluster $M_{500}$ range of $10^{13.67\\sim14.97}M_{\\odot}$ and a Brightest Central Galaxy (BCG) redshift range of $0.04\\sim0.89$. After excluding the lens candidates listed in previous studies, we identify 247 newly discovered cluster lens candidates, including 16 grade A, 90 grade B, and 141 grade C. This catalog of cluster lens candidates is publicly available online, and follow-up observations are encouraged to confirm and conduct thorough investigations of these systems."}

Molecular gas is a good tracer for central rings: Previous studies used ionized gas and dust tracers to identify central rings in galaxies of similar morphological types as this study. In comparison, we find similar fractions of galaxies hosting central rings and similar radii distributions. The gaseous central rings have typical radii of $400_{-150}^{+250}\\,$pc, molecular gas masses of $\\log(M_\\text{mol}/M_\\odot){\\sim}8.1_{-0.23}^{+0.17}$, and SFRs of $0.21_{-0.16}^{+0.15}\\,M_\\odot/\\text{yr}$, thus contributing $5.6_{-2.1}^{+4.5}\\,\\%$ and $13_{-5}^{+10}\\,\\%$ to their host galaxies' molecular gas mass and SFR.

Longer bars contain more massive molecular central rings, but we find no correlation between bar strength and the ring's molecular gas content. Although absolute central ring properties likely depend on host galaxy properties, the similarities between the MW CMZ and PHANGS central rings in relative parameters suggest that the processes of gas inflow and star formation are similar for central rings across nearby galaxies."}

Using multiple identification methods, we have identified 248 deblended SMG candidates for 192 SCUBA-2 sources. The average multiplicity of SCUBA-2 sources is $\\sim$26%, with brighter sources exhibiting higher multiplicity. After applying quality cuts based on SED fitting reliability, our final sample comprises 221 SMGs associated with 186 SCUBA-2 sources. The SSA22 SMGs have a median infrared luminosity of (2.25$\\pm$0.25) $\\times$10$^{12}$ L$_{\\odot}$, with $\\sim$ 63% ($\\sim$ 8%) of the sample classified as ULIRGs (HLIRGs).

A DM-only run counterpart of Auriga allows us to compare results with and without baryons. We repopulate the original suites with low-mass subhalos orders of magnitude lighter than the mass resolution limit, starting from a detailed characterization of Auriga data in the well-resolved subhalo mass range. The survival of low-mass subhalos to tidal forces is unclear and under debate nowadays, thus in our study we stay agnostic and consider two different levels of subhalo resilience to tidal stripping ('fragile' and 'resilient' subhalos). We find baryons to alter the Galactic substructure significantly, by decreasing its overall abundance by a factor $\\sim2.4$ (fragile) and $\\sim1.9$ (resilient) and subhalo concentration -- here defined in terms of maximum circular velocity -- by $\\sim1.5$ with respect to the DM-only scenario. This has important consequences for indirect searches of DM. As an example, we investigated the case of using unidentified gamma-ray sources to set constraints on the DM particle properties, assuming some of them may be dark satellites. We find the DM annihilation cross-section constraints to worsen by a factor $\\sim3.6$ in the most realistic scenario of including baryons, compared to DM-only simulations in the 'fragile' setup. Yet, a stronger resilience of subhalos to tidal stripping improves these DM limits by a factor $\\sim4.5$ and $\\sim10$ compared to the DM-only and hydrodynamical 'fragile' cases, respectively. Our results show the importance of including baryons to properly characterize the Galactic subhalo population, as well as to propose the most optimal subhalo search strategies, not only via its potential DM annihilation products but also through their gravitational signatures."}

Submitted to the ApJ. Comments welcome!", "summary": "We present a study of Pseudo-LRD-NOM (Pseudo little red dot with no metal lines), a highly magnified low-mass galaxy behind the lensing cluster Abell 370 at z=5.96. We classify this object as a pseudo-LRD because its red rest-frame optical colour is mainly driven by a prominent Halpha line (with EW0 >~ 800 Angstroms) present in its JWST NIRSpec spectrum. Halpha is dominated by a narrow component and also has a minor broad component indicative of an active black hole with M_BH = 2.9x10^6 Msun. A narrow Hbeta emission line is also detected (with S/N = 8), producing a Balmer decrement (narrow) Halpha/Hbeta = 11. The rest-frame UV spectral slope is beta_UVspec = -1.2. All these features can be ascribed to high dust attenuation. However, no [OIII]5007 or any other metal lines are detected in the spectrum, so [OIII]5007/Hbeta < 0.25, at odds with a simple dust-attenuation explanation. Accounting for all the spectral properties requires the model of a starburst with moderate colour excess E(B-V)=0.18-0.45, high gas density (n_H >~ 10^6 cm^{-3}) and extremely low gas/stellar metallicities (Z = 0.01-0.1 Zsun). The demagnified stellar mass is 1.62^{+1.54}_{-0.79} x10^7 Msun and the stellar-mass surface density is Sigma* = 418^{+725}_{-310} Msun/pc^2, similar to that of massive/nuclear star clusters. Pseudo-LRD-NOM provides evidence of massive black-hole growth occurring in a high-density, dusty starburst which is at the early stages of its chemical enrichment, and is likely a precursor to a real LRD."}

In this work, we model the reionization history under the Early Dark Energy (EDE) paradigm -- originally proposed to ease the Hubble tension -- which also explains the observed over-abundance of high-$z$ galaxies without extreme star formation efficiencies. The EDE model yields reionization histories consistent with current constraints while requiring only moderate LyC escape fractions and UV luminosity densities ($f_{\\rm esc}\\sim 0.05-0.1$, $M_{\\rm UV}\\lesssim -17$ to $-15$).

For a diffraction-limited PSF, as arises in space-based missions, this correction depends on each galaxy SED. In the Euclid mission, galaxy SED reconstruction, a tasks of the photometric-redshift processing function (PHZ PF), relies on broad- and medium-band ancillary photometry. The limited wavelength sampling of the Euclid VIS passband and signal-to-noise ratio may affect the reconstruction accuracy and translate into biases in the weak lensing measurements. In this study, we present the methodology, which is employed in the Euclid PHZ PF, for reconstructing galaxy SEDs at 55 wavelengths, sampling the VIS passband every 10 nm, and we assess whether it fulfils the accuracy requirements imposed on the Euclid PSF model. We employ both physics- and data-driven methods, focusing on a new approach of template-based flux correction and Gaussian processes, and we introduce an SED metric whose bias propagates into PSF quadrupole moment errors. Our findings demonstrate that Gaussian processes and template fitting meet the requirements only in specific, but complementary, redshift intervals. We therefore propose a hybrid approach, which leverages both methods. This solution proves to be effective in meeting the Euclid accuracy requirements for most of the redshift range of the survey. Finally, we investigate the impact on the SED reconstruction of a new set of 16 evenly-spaced medium-band filters for the Subaru telescope, providing quasi-spectroscopic coverage of the VIS passband. This study shows promising results, ensuring accurate SED reconstruction and meeting the mission PSF requirements. This work thus provides not only the methodological foundation of galaxy SED reconstruction in the Euclid PHZ PF, but also a roadmap for future improvements using a new medium-band survey."}

The total radio continuum shows an asymmetry that extends northwest, mirroring the HI gas distribution, but showing distinct features in the extraplanar regions. The spectral index steepens systematically from $α\\sim-0.6$ in the main disk to $α\\sim-1.1$ in the outer disk. We find that the spectral index behavior of the outer disk is mainly due to an ICM shock that can re-accelerate electrons and a significant reduction of thermal emission. Intriguingly, extraplanar clouds exhibit exceptionally flat spectral indices ($α\\sim-0.2$ to $0$), resulting from a combination of significantly enhanced thermal emission and pronounced spectral aging of the non-thermal component. Although some of these regions correlate with H$α$, others do not. We propose that the mixing between the ICM and interstellar medium (ISM) is an alternative mechanism that enhances thermal emission independently of star formation. Polarized continuum emissions are highly asymmetric, preferentially distributed along the ICM wind side, and the polarization fraction increases radially outward from the galactic midplane, indicating that the polarized emission is strongly influenced by the ICM wind. Our results show how and where the ICM substantially affects the ISM, and also demonstrate that high-frequency observations are crucial for analyzing the radio continuum of ram pressure stripping galaxies."}

Using newly constructed catalogs of YSCs in the emerging phase (eYSCs), identified in the infrared with JWST, and optical YSCs detected in archival HST data, we compute TPCFs for various cluster samples and age bins across the four galaxies as part of the FEAST (Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star ClusTers) program.

NGC 628 exhibits a clear distinction between the TPCFs of eYSCs and oYSCs, implying a shorter randomization timescale.
