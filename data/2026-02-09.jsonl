For the South Pole Telescope's third-generation camera (SPT-3G), accurate characterization of the beam is critical for understanding the polarized mm-wave sky. Here, we present direct measurements of SPT-3G's polarized beam response using observations of 100 polarized extragalactic point sources. Previous SPT-3G CMB power spectrum analyses introduced a phenomenological parameter $β_\\mathrm{pol}$ to describe the degree of polarization preserved in beam sidelobes. These analyses found evidence for significant depolarization driven by the requirement of polarization power spectrum consistency between different frequency bands. Our direct measurements yield $β_\\mathrm{pol}=0.90\\pm0.10$ at 95 GHz, $1.01\\pm0.12$ at 150 GHz, and $0.81\\pm0.29$ at 220 GHz, indicating minimal sidelobe depolarization. We validate these results through extensive systematic tests including Bayesian posterior sampling versus frequentist bootstrap resampling, real-space versus Fourier-space analysis, and variations on temperature-to-polarization leakage handling, covariance determination, and source selection. When compared to values inferred from previous cosmological analyses, which favored significant depolarization to resolve inter-frequency power spectrum inconsistencies, we find a mild tension of $1.9σ$. However, this apparent discrepancy is dependent on the beam modeling, as our point source-based analysis derives much of its constraining power on $β_\\mathrm{pol}$ from higher multipoles than the power spectrum analysis. These measurements therefore admit three explanations for the frequency-dependent residuals observed in the power spectrum analysis: a statistical fluctuation, the need for more sophisticated polarized beam models, or systematics other than beam depolarization."}

Accurate measurements of cluster's total masses are therefore essential, yet they can be challenging, particularly for clusters with complex morphologies, as simple mass profiles are often adopted to fit the measurements. In this work, we focus on the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters: a sample of six extremely massive systems, that, in most cases, exhibit highly complex mass distributions. The BUFFALO survey extended the Hubble Space Telescope observations for the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters, providing high-resolution multi-band imaging within a few Mpc. Combining this high-quality imaging dataset with ancillary spectroscopy, we produce weak-lensing catalogues with very high source densities, about 50 sources/arcmin$^2$. This allows us to robustly estimate the individual weak-lensing cluster masses and quantify the sensitivity of these measurements on different factors, such as the cluster centring, the uncertainty on the redshift distribution or the foreground contamination and boost factor correction. This provides a data-driven analysis of the different sources of systematics that can impact such measurements. We find that the largest sources of systematic bias arise for the most disturbed clusters, such as the multi-modal, merging galaxy cluster Abell 2744. This analysis sets a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of systematics on the weak-lensing estimates of cluster masses, and in particular, in the case of unrelaxed clusters. This can play a key role in forthcoming cosmological analyses based on wide-field surveys such as Euclid and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time of the Rubin Observatory."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "(Abridged) A thorough interpretation of the current and upcoming generation of cosmological observations requires unprecedented large-scale, high-resolution simulations spanning multiple cosmological models and parameters. The realization of these computationally demanding simulations poses a crucial technical challenge. We present beyond - $Λ$CDM implementations of the Dynamic Zoom Simulations (DZS) method, a performance-enhancing technique tailored for large-scale simulations that produce lightcone-like outputs. This approach dynamically decreases the resolution of a simulation in the regions that are not in causal connection with the observer, saving computational resources without directly affecting the physical properties within the lightcone. We implemented the DZS algorithm in two state-of-the-art codes supporting non-standard cosmologies, namely modified $f(R)$ gravity in Arepo and dark sector interactions in Gadget4. We analyzed result accuracy and performance gains across resolution, simulation volume and model by comparing runs performed with and without the DZS algorithm. Our DZS reproduce the lightcone halo mass function, sky-projected massmaps, and matter and weak lensing convergence power spectra with an accuracy of $\\simeq$ 0.1% or higher in most cases. In terms of performance, DZS runs in our test simulations can save up to $\\sim$ 50% runtime compared to the non-DZS counterparts. A scaling to larger simulated volumes suggests that performance gains could improve by an additional $\\sim$ 20% at the resolution levels of current state-of-the-art simulations. The validation of the DZS algorithm in non-standard models demonstrates that this technique can enable cost effective, large-scale ($\\gtrsim$ 1 cGpc/h) simulations with state-of-the-art resolution, providing the computational framework needed to constrain and help the interpretation of forthcoming data."}

In this paper, we derive splashback radii for this cluster ensemble from galaxy density profiles and constrain the mass threshold of the survey as a function of redshift. We use MaDCoWS2 cluster candidates at $0.4\\leq z \\leq 1.65$ divided into subsamples with different signal-to-noise (S/N$_{\\rm P}$) and redshifts, cross-correlated with galaxies from the CatWISE2020 catalog, to obtain average surface density profiles.

A distinct splashback feature is detected in all subsamples. The measured splashback radii span from $0.89^{+0.02}_{-0.02}h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc/cMpc ($0.61^{+0.02}_{-0.02}h^{-1}$ proper Mpc/pMpc) at $\\overline{z}=0.45$ to $1.27^{+0.05}_{-0.05}h^{-1}$ cMpc ($0.53^{+0.04}_{-0.04}h^{-1}$ pMpc) at $\\overline{z}=1.54$.

MaDCoWS2 $M_{\\rm 200m}$ values derived from the simulation-based relation are lower than the expected values based on weak-lensing observations.

The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\\ell$ versus high-$\\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\\,σ$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $τ$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for. We conclude that claims of a required update of our standard cosmological model from LCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature."}

For each PBH mass, we compute the redshift-dependent energy injection from Hawking evaporation using \\texttt{BlackHawk}, fully accounting for the time evolution of the PBH mass and the complete spectrum of emitted Standard Model particles and gravitons. The resulting photons and electrons are propagated through the primordial plasma using \\texttt{DarkHistory}, which self-consistently models EM cascades and determines the fraction of injected energy deposited into ionization, excitation, and heating of the IGM. These modifications to the ionization and thermal histories are incorporated into a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the free-electron fraction based on low-$\\ell$ CMB polarization data from the \\textit{Planck} mission. This non-parametric approach allows for a statistically well-defined separation between exotic high-redshift energy injection and late-time astrophysical reionization, allowing PBH evaporation to be constrained through its contribution to the high-redshift optical depth. Requiring consistency with current CMB measurements, we obtain upper limits on the initial PBH abundance that are robust against reionization modeling uncertainties and systematically more conservative than existing bounds, reflecting the fully numerical and time-dependent treatment of Hawking evaporation and energy deposition. Our results demonstrate the power of reionization observables as a precision probe of PBH evaporation and other scenarios involving late-time energy injection."}

This `$J_\\varphi$-${\\overline{v}}_R$ wave' signal also exhibits a systematic phase shift when stars are binned by their dynamical temperatures. However, the origin of the wave is unknown. Here we use linear perturbation theory to derive a simple analytic formula for the $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ signal that depends on the equilibrium properties of the Galaxy and the history of recent perturbations to it. The formula naturally explains the phase shift, but also predicts that different classes of perturbation should drive $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ signals with very different morphologies. Ignoring the self-gravity of disk fluctuations, it suggests that neither a distant tidal kick (e.g., from the Sgr dwarf) nor a rigidly-rotating Galactic bar can produce a qualitatively correct $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ wave signal. However, short-lived spiral arms can, and by performing an MCMC fit we identify a spiral perturbation that drives a $J_\\varphi$-${\\overline{v}}_R$ signal in reasonable agreement with the data.

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Some cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a key role in powering the Ly$α$ nebulae observed around high-redshift quasars. In such simulations, AGN feedback seeded as powerful outflows leads to extended and luminous nebulae whose morphology and surface-brightness profiles accurately reproduce the observations, while suppressing AGN feedback leads to compact and faint nebulae. This link might arise from outflows opening up a channel for Ly$α$ photons to escape from the galactic nucleus to the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The main aim of this paper is to test this theoretical prediction using observations, by comparing the physical properties of outflows and Ly$α$ nebulae. We analyze integral-field unit data obtained with VLT/ERIS and GEMINI/GNIRS to trace the ionized gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a sample of six quasars at $z\\sim2-3$, using the [O III] emission line. We detect powerful outflows in all the quasars of our sample, with velocities $>1500~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and kinetic energies $ \\gtrsim 2\\times10^{43}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. Four of our quasars are spatially resolved and show signs of extended [O III] emission out to distances $>2$ kpc from the central supermassive black hole. When excluding one outlier, we find a positive monotonic correlation between the outflow power and the Ly$α$ nebulae size ($ρ=0.89$, $p=0.03$) and luminosity ($ρ=0.6$, $p=0.28$). Additionally, we find evidence of spatial alignment between the ionization cone and the inner and brightest regions of the Ly$α$ nebula. Our results provide tentative evidence in support of the theoretical prediction that AGN-driven outflows at ISM scales open a low-optical-depth path for central Ly$α$ photons to reach the CGM and create extended nebulae."}

We build a simplified cluster evolutionary model in the $Λ$CDM framework to constrain the characteristic timescales of this transformation. In our model, field spirals joining the cluster are subject to ram-pressure stripping (RPS), which removes their gas reservoir leading to the quenching of their star formation on a timescale $t_{\\rm s}$, and to an (initially) unspecified mechanism that transforms them into S0s on a timescale $t_{\\rm m}$. We assume that $t_{\\rm s}$ and $t_{\\rm m}$ are independent and both power-law functions of $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$, the galaxy-to-cluster mass ratio. We constrain our model using the observed distribution of spirals and S0s in a color-mass plane from the OmegaWINGS and EDisCS cluster surveys at $z\\simeq0.055$ and $z\\simeq0.7$. Our best-fit model reproduces the data remarkably well and predicts evolutionary trends for the main morphological fractions in agreement with previous studies. We find typical $t_{\\rm s}$ between $0.1$ and $1$ Gyr, compatible with previous estimates. A surprisingly strong anti-correlation between $t_{\\rm s}$ and $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$ is required in order to suppress the formation of red, low-mass spirals at low redshift, which we interpret as driven by orbit anisotropy. Conversely, $t_{\\rm m}$ depends very weakly on $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$ and has typical values of a few Gyr. The inferred morphological evolution is compatible with that resulting from the ageing of the stellar populations in galaxies abruptly quenched by ram pressure stripping: we confirm spectrophotometric ageing as a key channel for the spiral-to-S0 transition in galaxy clusters, with secular evolution playing a secondary role."}
