Submitted to Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "summary": "The vertical structure of stellar discs provides key constraints on their formation and evolution. Nearby spirals, including the Milky Way, host thin and thick components that may arise either from an early turbulent phase or from the subsequent dynamical heating of an initially thin disc; measuring disc thickness across cosmic time therefore offers a direct test of these scenarios. We present a new methodology to measure the thickness of edge-on galaxies that explicitly accounts for small departures from perfectly edge-on orientations by fitting a full three-dimensional model with forward modelling. This improves on traditional approaches that assume an inclination of $90^\\circ$ and can bias thicknesses high. Applying the method to \\textit{JWST} imaging of galaxies at $1<z<3$ with stellar masses $\\gtrsim 10^9~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ from four major surveys, we measure a median scale height of $z_0 = 0.25\\pm0.14~\\mathrm{kpc}$ and a median ratio $h_r/z_0 = 8.4\\pm3.7$. These values are consistent with the Milky Way and local thin discs, but imply scale heights $\\sim 1.6$ times smaller than those inferred for local galaxies from single-disc fits. This result implies that thin discs are already present at $z\\sim3$. We further show that a thick disc contributing 10\\% of the thin-disc luminosity would be detectable in the data considered in this work, implying that any thick disc present must be fainter and favouring a scenario in which thick discs build up progressively through dynamical heating."}

We conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the converging flow of atomic gas, including a simple chemical network and tracer particles that move along the local velocity field. Then we perform detailed chemical network calculations along the trajectory of each tracer particle. The diffuse part of forming molecular clouds is CO-poor; i.e., H$_2$ and CO abundances do not correlate. In diffuse regions of $n_\\mathrm{H}\\lesssim 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, we find that the abundances of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing molecules are determined by steady-state chemistry reflecting the local H$_2$ abundance, which is determined by the gas density along the trajectory. In denser regions, the abundances are affected by water ice formation, which changes the elemental abundance of carbon and oxygen (i.e., C/O ratio) in the gas phase. Assuming quasi-steady-state chemistry given the abundances of major molecules (e.g., H$_2$) from the simple network, we derive analytic solutions for molecular abundances, which reproduce the calculation results. We also calculate the molecular column densities based on the spatial distribution of tracer particles and their molecular abundances, and compare them with observations of diffuse molecular clouds. We find that the column densities of CH, CCH, and OH are linearly correlated with those of H$_2$, which supports the empirical relation used in the observations. On the other hand, the column density of HCO$^+$ shows non-linear dependence on the H$_2$ column density, reflecting the difference in HCO$^+$ formation paths in CO-poor and CO-rich regions."}

We present a polarimetric study of the HH objects HH 80 and HH 81 from where non-thermal emission has been confirmed through spectral index measurements at low frequencies. We carried out observations of HH 80 and HH 81 with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in 4-6 GHz. Unlike the inner jet knots, no linear polarization is detected towards the knots HH 80 and HH 81. We place a $3σ$ upper limit of $30~μ$Jy on the polarization intensity, corresponding to fractional polarization limits of $Π_{\\max}\\approx0.02$ and $0.01$ for HH 80 and HH 81, respectively. To interpret this non-detection, we assess the conditions for synchrotron polarization and the impact of depolarization mechanisms. The shock cooling parameter $χ_\\mathrm{s}$ is lower in these outermost HH objects than in the inner knots, indicating that the reverse shocks in HH 80-81 are less efficient at accelerating relativistic electrons compared with the inner knots. Moreover, Faraday depolarization appears severe: the dispersion in the estimated rotation measure $σ_{\\rm RM}\\sim400~\\mathrm{rad~m^{-2}}$ is comparable to or larger than observed RM values themselves. This is consistent with strong fluctuations and turbulence. Together with beam depolarization, these effects can suppress the observable fractional polarization flux densities below the detectable thresholds. We conclude that reduced acceleration efficiency (when compared to inner knots) and strong depolarization account for the absence of polarized emission towards HH 80 and HH 81."}

In the classical astrophysical methodology, multi-band continuum data are required to derive the dust temperature. The present study aims to investigate the capability and limitations of machine learning techniques to derive dust temperatures in regions without multi-band dust continuum data. We investigated how the number of pixels used for training influences prediction accuracy, and how the dust temperatures sampled in the training area influence prediction accuracy. We found that $\\sim$5\\% of the total number of pixels in the observational region is sufficient for training to obtain accurate predictions. Furthermore, a dust temperature sample within the training area should cover the whole temperature range and have a similar sample distribution to that of the entire observing region for an accurate prediction. The $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is often found to be the most important feature in predicting the dust temperature. As the $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is a tracer of PDR, the machine learning technique could connect the dust temperatures to the PDRs. We also found that the condition of thermal gas-dust coupling is not required for accurate prediction of the dust temperature from the molecular line data, and that machine learning is capable of capturing information more than classical astrophysical concepts."}

There are only six molecules containing N-O bond that are detected in gaseous phase in interstellar medium. One of those is nitrous oxide (N2O), which was searched for but not found in solid form from as early as Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) mission was launched. The observational capabilities of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) present a possibility to identify solid interstellar N2O.\n  Aims. We aim to identify nitrous oxide in open JWST spectra of interstellar ices towards a sample of Class 0, 0/I and flat protostars using the relevant laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing interstellar ice analogues.\n  Methods. A set of laboratory infrared transmission spectra was obtained for the following mixtures: N2O:CO2=1:20, N2O:CO=1:20, N2O:N2=1:20, N2O:CO2:CO=1:15:5, N2O:CO2:N2=1:15:13 at 10-23 K. A search for N2O in JWST NIRSpec spectra towards 50 protostars was performed by fitting the 4.44-4.47 um (2250-2235 cm-1) NN-stretch absorption band with new laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing ices.\n  Results. We claim the first secure identification of N2O in 16 protostars. The fitting results show that N2O is formed predominantly within the apolar layer of the ice mantles, rich in CO, CO2 and N2. The abundance of solid N2O is estimated as 0.2-2.1% relative to solid CO. We present band strengths for N2O in the mixtures corresponding to the apolar layer. Also, an identification of the C-N stretch band at 4.42 um (2260 cm-1) is reported, which we tentatively assign to HNCO, the simplest C-N bond carrier."}

Submitted to Astronomy & Computing, comments welcomed", "summary": "The possibility to constrain cosmological parameters from galaxy surveys using field-level machine learning methods that bypass traditional summary statistics analyses, depends crucially on our ability to generate simulated training sets. The latter need to be both realistic, as to reproduce the key features of the real data, and produced in large numbers, as to allow us to refine the precision of the training process. The analysis presented in this paper is an attempt to respond to these needs by (a) using clusters of galaxies as tracers of large-scale structure, together with (b) adopting a 3LPT code (Pinocchio) to generate a large training set of $32\\,768$ mock X-ray cluster catalogues. X-ray luminosities are stochastically assigned to dark matter haloes using an empirical $M-L_X$ scaling relation. Using this training set, we test the ability and performances of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the cosmological parameters, based on an input overdensity field derived from the cluster distribution. We perform a comparison with a neural network trained on traditional summary statistics, that is, the abundance of clusters and their power spectrum. Our results show that the field-level analysis combined with the cluster abundance yields a mean absolute relative error on the predicted values of $Ω_{\\rm m}$ and $σ_8$ that is a factor of $\\sim 10 \\%$ and $\\sim 20\\%$ better than that obtained from the summary statistics. Furthermore, when information about the individual luminosity of each cluster is passed to the CNN, the gain in precision exceeds $50\\%$."}

In particular, the amount of carbon relative to oxygen is known to have a strong effect on modeled abundances of many species. While previous studies have focused on comparison of modeled and observed abundances to constrain the C/O ratio, the effects of this parameter on the underlying chemistry have not been well-studied. We investigated the role of the C/O ratio on dark cloud chemistry using the NAUTILUS code and machine learning techniques for molecular representation. We find that modeled abundances are quite sensitive to the C/O ratio, especially for carbon-rich species such as carbon chains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). CO and simple ice-phase species are found to be major carbon reservoirs under both oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich conditions. The appearance of C3H4 isomers as significant carbon reservoirs, even under oxygen-rich conditions, indicates the efficiency of gas-phase C3 formation followed by adsorption and grain-surface hydrogenation. Our model is not able to reproduce the observed, gas-phase C/H ratio of TMC-1 CP at the time of best fit with any C/O ratio between 0.1 and 3, suggesting that the modeled freeze-out of carbon-bearing molecules may be too rapid. Future investigations are needed to understand the reactivity of major carbon reservoirs and their conversion to complex organic molecules."}

Approximately 1000 HII region complexes are detected in both galaxies and analyzed using their strong optical emission lines. Their properties were studied via BPT diagrams and their luminosity function. We conducted a detailed study of the distribution of oxygen abundance across the system using a series of strong-line O/H indicators and calibrations. Both galaxies exhibit negative galactocentric abundance gradients with a slope -0.015 dex kpc$^{-1}$. There are marginal signs of discontinuities in the O/H gradients with some indicators while no significant azimuthal variations are seen. A shallower slope in the HII region luminosity function between the arm and inter-arm regions in IC 2163 is observed, supporting previous conclusion that the star formation process in this galaxy eyelids has been altered during the interaction. The kinematics of the ionised gas reveal disturbed velocity fields, AGN-like features in the nucleus of NGC 2207, and elevated velocity dispersion in turbulent or feedback-driven regions. To interpret these findings, we modeled the collision using the numerical algorithm GCD+. The simulation reproduces key features of the system and demonstrates how close passages drive enhanced star formation and localized chemical enrichment. Finally, two dwarf galaxies in the field are found to have very similar systemic velocities as their larger counterparts, and could well play a minor role in the global interaction based on their morphology and position."}

They are of particular interest because they represent a strong prediction of the LCDM model. As of today, only a handful of candidates have been observed, the most intriguing of which being Cloud-9. Using several state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, we aim to predict the abundance of dark galaxies expected within our Local Group (LG), characterise their properties and provide guidance for their potential detection. We analyse LG simulations with constrained initial conditions, run with different codes, implementing different baryonic physics, feedback prescriptions, and employing two distinct values of SF density threshold, n_th=0.13 and 10 cm^-3, to select samples of dark and bright galaxies harboured in haloes of similar mass. We demonstrate that dark galaxies exist in such simulations, though their number is larger in simulations that use a higher, more realistic n_th. These galaxies, whose gas remains diffuse and never forms stars, predominantly inhabit less-concentrated, higher-spin DM halos than their luminous counterparts. Dark galaxies are typically found in low-density regions at the outskirts of the LG, and their evolution across z indicate that both the DM and gas densities in their surroundings were consistently lower than those found around bright galaxies, making them less susceptible to interactions, mergers, or gas inflows. We estimate that up to 8 dark galaxies should be detectable in HI emission within 2.5 Mpc of the LG, with the FAST telescope, accounting for its sky coverage and minimum M_HI and N_HI. Current hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies, combined with upcoming HI surveys, will offer a direct and powerful test of LCDM through their ability to predict and measure properties of dark galaxies within and beyond the LG."}
